intp,his protectionist trade policies are stupid his support of torture and domestic spying are terrible i voted for him to stop hillary and send a message to the establishment i don t support huge portions of his policy the world is too dark too evil with too many problems and not enough help it overwhelms the contemplative soul it just too much i guess if i can think god save us from the unthinking and incurious minds our xfxjs can think i m a nd rate heart the idea of gifts differing is an important one we each have our gifts and while we shouldn t be jerks or idiots we must be who we are a family member said that people who are empathetic and caring are better people than uncaring unemotional geniuses angers me greatly uh not the insurance companies main customer is advertisers just that it not the patient i appreciate that and i m willing to end the back and forth if you want has tons of free books is advertisers like employer based health insurance with internet content i think local weather will change the profit motive imo works as long as the right person is the customer for news stations the primary customer they are motivated by money it just the people money taken by force and appropriated by congress problems tv weather must give people something they want more than accuracy since they re most popular sorry for the next expletive language and long term it doesn t make sense for a bank to devalue their currency eventually people don t want it they are motivated by power and money the fed is controlled by banks as it is but without competition the fed may not have the same profit incentive but neither do politicians yet they are no angels among men i would trust government to make breakfast cereal or automobiles why trust them to make currency or laws i don t think this holds up if this is true in principle why not nationalize all industry why doesn t communism work general james maddog mattis comment with any other opinions few people have enough light to understand the vast darkness in their understanding so they feel omniscient there isn t much cheaper than and and they re pretty much secure and would be more so with more competition if i m fidelity i want the best most secure most widely accepted currency perhaps digital only backed by silver in the fledgling currency market today precious metals bitcoins etc we don t see widespread problems positively reputation in the market aren t cheats amp thieves avoided aren t markets not govts places of innovation the problems you list are essentially the problems the fed had now in the long run doesn t a currency issuer want a the best options there would likely be way more than three options and like search engines people would gravitate toward three best options and companies would innovate maybe they back their currency with silver gold shares of the company commodities etc there would be many options not necessarily a bank could issue paper digital currency backed by something customers trust once you become knowledgeable you have an obligation to do something dr ron paul i completely agree with you we should imo the best alternative is to just let the market work w o official i rewatched some of the gop presidential debates dr ron paul is such a hero to me his arguments are so coherent and consistent i only wish was that really me was three times as long nardi work is extraordinarily interesting it seems fitting that my boss i m a software engineer has the lotr trilogy and star wars on his desk as permanent fixtures makea some days i doubt i m autistic other days someone asks me through pm are you an aspie i d say days out of i feel aspie the blessing of being an autistic intp is my challenges and my disinterests often overlap it harder for social aspies i think chairman yellen will fight to delay an economic correction thereby making the eventual correction worse i think you re better to split up than marry someone you want to change temperament for example can t be changed some months ago i argued that based on what i knew i felt mike pence was isfj recent has typed him as such awesome well thanks for the great podcasts i ve listened to in a week i look forward to whatever is coming next gary johnson asactually makes a whole lot sense i ll have to rethink my estp typing of him interesting podcasts i just started listening i see you followfolks are you a rothbardian i think i m done for tonight but it has been fun nice to meet you then why the hoopla lol the only reason google has so much search dominance is because they are good at it what do you propose govt do about it look at the recent epipen scandal here in the usa the co pany had connections to the legislature who barred competition here alternatives i could make an alternative myself but it doesn t exist at all yahoo bing duckduckgo they each provide different users something they want most in what area do they not have competition should govt force people to use crappy search engines can t fault a good site idealistically any imaginable utopia is possible including a stateless one i m talking about what govt is in truth government creates monopolies through tax credits special loop holes and partnerships google doesn t have monopoly the way to the to is providing a product of service that people think is more valuable than their money that virtuous if that what a government did but most government functions have nothing to do with protecting true rights the state does more of that than anyone else monopolies are creations of government cronies not cooperations and in the private sector there is competition we each get to choose for ourselves with government we are compelled that how huge parts of society work now you don t think anything the government does could be done privately why as long as a man is benefitted by helping others he will continue helping them supply and demand but most people do care about others in our free will society out people donate huge amounts of resources to help others did idaho farmers get up and tend to fields because they love new yorkers their self interest feeds strangers yes and no self interest has given us so much good are politicians selfless angelic beings it is impossible to predict market innovation in sectors that are currently banned but i can theorize a specific sector how can we stop theft and extortion with a government when their lifeblood is theft and extortion this is an extremely broad question the best parts of society are already free is there some area in particular i d gladly help you with any areas of confusion or frustration question away is far far too rapid and we don t see a long slowly changing chain of creatures in the fossil record we see leaps not for me for the science rapid evolution only occurs in simple short lived creatures the explosion of new creatures we are the only truly free market school of economic thought we are mostly anarcho capitalists oh certainly i m just saying given the limited timeframe biological evolution doesn t seem plausible it is as though they were just planted there without any evolutionary history it far too rapid well the creatures that arise in the cambrian explosion would be a good example dawkins even states really i find that interesting i think you can find a lot of intellectuals in our ranks particularly the mises variety lol i think the evidence is fairly strong certainly darwinian evolution has some serious problems of late at least that not my journey for me belief in god was the answer to a single question but has implications well certainly my theological beliefs do help inform all of my other beliefs but god isn t the answer to an equation libertarianism take a little more dot connecting and tweets probably wouldn t been a good medium for those arguments fundamentally if free will is correct calvinism and determinism cannot be working toward austrian economics and well one illustration i use when arguing calvinists is if god controls everything he has forced me to say he doesn t
intp,betchya can t start by the end of the year this year i m thankful for my success rate at staying alive so far it is an ongoing journey you re right yo raise your hands if you actually practically finished something this month hey that better than nothing cool i ve only started like project ideas and abandoned in the last month brb starting more projects that i ll forget about in hours ooo interesting gonna have to do some more research on that and unsurprisingly many of you have very specific and nuanced definitions of your political alignments the super scientific results are in of votes of us align more as democrat than republican interesting push the button for the party you usually end up voting with or really i think it gets behind you it all good got it i identify as libertarian more closely than other parties but vote democrat due to party representation in our system doubtfulis perfectly aligned with either but they arethe in power curious aboutvoting habits today poll which political party are you more aligned with i know that feel anyone else it amazing how time does that do any of youfolk blog regularly if yes what the topic example of an intp hard at work tell me more that actually makes a lot of sense is a lot of books to finish though congrats lots of high pressure jobs here dang how d you like it woah did you finish any yet i bet i didn t mean you held it chaotically but that it sounds like a naturally chaotic thing to regulate that sounds chaotic awesome so the majority at said arts other in the polls for career bucket if you chose that option i m curious what your line of work is sure why not silly enough i have blogged probably books worth of content since then just not authored an actual book participating in short term writing events helps i always make the most progress when i dedicate to a sprint goal insert ninja gif i hear you i also have a book years in the works words already but can t bring myself to finish it x teaching yourself a new language is hard lulls are natural congrats on keeping it up over time i think that counts progress takes constant effort towards one goal which is something we normally lack let defystereotypes what a personal project you stuck with for years retweeting answers to support general consensus is i ll get on the phone for work but otherwise prefer texting perhaps because text is easier for articulation intps care to weigh in i for one avoid phone calls at almost all costs thanks but no thanks we sleep on the corpses of abandoned projects i think you re absolutely on target thanks for entertaining this discussion about it it been insightful that fair enough the point of this syndrome is more that you feel a fraud and your achievements don t count because they re not legit it often hard to know what our achievements mean in the end they re not always appreciated as such in their time but that doesn t mean we didn t achieve them in the first place honestly it so silly because it rational to become accustomed to new circumstances read achievements or you ve convinced yourself into believing you haven t really achieved anything what your career bucket let us know what if you re other there were only choice slots sorry discuss impostor syndrome and the intp that moment where you stop enjoying a movie because it doesn t even follow its own universe logic anat work what your latest project retweet if you just remembered a project you accidentally abandoned like years ago oh my god talk about pulling an intp the easiest way to lose some weight i could rule the world only i can t stick to one plan for more than hours oh god the ideas make it stop when an intp goes rogue on a diy project being an intp is having too many ideas to share all at once and then overwhelming your friends with all of your output we got all sorts of peeps talking about their worldview and religion on the fb page what your opinion to be an intp is to make other people tired with your constant stream of new ideas panic worry i m an intp after the knee jerk reactions are over i m good i m a web developer what are you tweet like you re an extrovert tweet i could hack but i m too busy programming according to the portrait most hackers fall into intj and intp that moment when you re like this project is way bigger than i thought fuuuuuu
intp,do you feel guilty breaking up with your ex who was not really but i broke up with her because i didn how often do you question your faith it hard to say as a skeptic i m always second gu does small talk make you feel awkward haha most of the time it kind of doesn t but when someo yeah it wasn t my brightest moment actually the answer is incomplete here i tried to change her and that wasn t cool either no as far as i know why did your last relationship end i am a christian and she wasn t i tried to change ask me something you re absolutely right but this tweet is probably just a random interaction between one intp and one istj tries to show off every single ability they have if done they feel as if they under performed probably oh see i did not know that how do people relate these pics to those captions oh no that not a problem it just that we were probably dragged there b but this is a not interested um intp the idea here is to interact oh don t mind me i ll just watch so kso what type is it i say intp but that might be because of its inability to filter most thoughts very often except the feel part stage is as far as i got option laugh out loud one would think so yeah but then i find myself watching these videos on youtube silence ftw but not just at night though am i afraid of sleep why do i avoid it like the plague do you know why no one has taken advantage of it teach me something when you ve got to handle more than one emotion at the time aw man my money was on funny thing is most people advice for others is be daring but play it safe for themselves myself included and lastly you now work at a supermarket and don t get any free days that what i can come up with rn you ve caught an infection and have to stay in bed at the hospital for two weeks or you ve already booked a flight yet the social rituals are most of the time illogical which makes dealing with social issues so frustrating looking for answers or advice might find a lame pun here instead i thought that being called cute while on this filter was rather an insult it covers most of the face therefore same here
intp,pure mathematics is in its way the poetry of logical ideas albert einstein and texting someone we are romantically interested in how true is this glad you liked it at i m the stereotypical grandma i like sitting alone on a comfy chair wearing comfy gray clothes and big glasses and baking cookies yes and when i start to welcome the possibility that someone could hear my thoughts i start to think of weird pr the male intp was infuriating lol it felt like i was dating a younger version of me i ve met two actually i became good friends with one of them i ve also met and kind of dated a male intp as well true yeah i guess i just need to remind myself that it a waste of time to compare myself to everyone else thanks for me it starts with jealousy then goes into self criticism i feel awful when i have these feelings how do you guys deal with jealousy can you make it go away it difficult to put thoughts and ideas into words so i end up shrugging confession i have the most random and unusual interests it feels like the more i know the more i realize i don t really know enough happy birthday i saw the movie months ago really me why now i think i have a crush on kylo ren i think if loving you was wrong i d rather be right i m always right ever had that feeling that you like something in theory but when it comes to the actual thing you don t i am often envious of how myfriends are naturally good at handling talking about emotions and aren t afraid of them i ve always loved the thought of not being what people expect me to be exactly omg lol well all of us do have our different interests i guess one of the things i m passionate about is memes yes i like that site bucket of water falls on head buildings fall around me gets hit by a meteor dies me oh lol i spaced out what did i miss is it just me who loves to collect memes and interesting pictures i have more than k on my phone or do other do this as well same i usually know where my things are unless somebody arranges my mess of stuff in which case idk anymore lol that makes it an even more difficult decision to make i salute you i guess we are good at taking criticism but it actually bothers us more than we let on since we lowkey want to be liked tips on being in a relationship with anpersonality type q chosen career field a i m currently studying to be an engineer hoping to also get an architecture degree after but idk yet willing to try if anyone wants to dm sounds fun i think this this is me right here me arrives min early i am a changed woman i am now very responsible and organized sec later me crap i left something important i think i m gonna faint esfj is very talkative and sensitive sometimes it overwhelming he is very sweet and always makes me feel loved entj is someone i can share my ideas to he is straightforward organized and supportive he is also a person willing to help i m an intp and my closest friends are infj entj and esfj infj is like a mother to me she is very supportive a i was thinking are esfjs really this annoying nah it probably just my sister lol hence this question came up hahahahaha quite true for uss as well hello fam question which type annoys you the most and why hello fam ask me questions here i procrastinate for the thrill of being under time pressure haha smart bossy is it just me or ares really attractive i ve felt that it feels like i have lost all reasoning which makes me mad stage because i don t know who i am anymore lol i ve only ever reached stage how about my fellows hahaha from anon tumblr when you have inferior i probably failed that physics test but idgaf because it christmas break finally glad i m not the only one then hahaha well i guess i have learned that others are easily offended and i must be sensitive to that so that counts right lol i was daydreaming in class yesterday when all of a sudden i panicked at the thought of anybody in the room being able to hear my thoughts i m not male but i m like this hmmm maybe i should get a shirt that says this lol omg i ve actually done this before to someone who asked me out haha my friends think i m funny when really i just blurted out something harsh yet completely true lol deadlines coming up and i m thinking about taking a nap again what new thanks i appreciate it that amazing maybe the best thing about being unsatisfied is it makes you want to explore more and see other options good to hear is this true for you the problem with me and essays is that i get the urge to insert my own sarcastic side comments and puns every time i make a point hahaha made me laugh then suddenly get depressed because i m not doing anything worthwhile and am just living for the weekends lol

intp,so that probably where it seems more like indoctrination i think both should be taught at home and at public not teaching the child evolution in the home where they have a chance to compare it to creation cold feet with science they struggle to find the balance a lot think well they ll deal with evolution in the outside world haha you didn t offend me my view is one shouldn t be taught without the other a lot of christian homeschool parents can get even if their child no longer believes like they do belief on me they showed me the facts let me do my own research and decide most people who homeschool want free thinkers actually that only happens in the duggar wanna be familes i know a lot of atheist homeschoolers my parents never forced a i was around people of all ages all backgrounds i knew what reality was most teens are stuck in this made up world when you re stuck with a bunch of people your age who think like you and tell you what to do you never look outside it kind of funny how they say homeschoolers are sheltered but we re some of the least offended out of the millennials this tweet also offends me everything offends me i m a millennial this tweet offends me i got intj been thinking if i were to form a romantic relationship it should probably be with inxj i ve gotten hours of sleep but i feel like i got maybe maybe hours i really want to reply to you and give you a good response but everytime i go to answer i forget everything i know if i was a pastor this would pretty much be my sermons the brick wall at least listens you must tell me what these links lead to otherwise it was to the coffee flavors we liked i knew what we were talking about i just didn t kn i hope you all know i m watching you all with my big red eye burning into your soul fear me i love this very much we re not sinners we just keep doing the damn things stop doing the things guys yes to both we are far from the stereotypical woman it confuses people yes to both i ve just notice those types of women seem to go through very similar things by feeling nothing i mean not feeling everything at once all the time me feels nothing for days straight me so relatable it hurts it does i notice intj intp and istp women relate a lot to similar things it could work if the istj wasn t insecure imo the istj i know is very insecure causes problems me he also more clever when it comes to jokes he very laid back she super stressed out they re relationship is odd to me oh my gosh that is my brother and his girlfriend they re pretty good couple she just let him get away with things i had one lesbian a long time ago and a few pan but mostly bi i spend most of my day wondering about everything i for some reason seem to attract bisexual females i m not sure why this is i really needed this thank you always hand write every thing you do involving money only way i keep track of mine praying friend how are you spending tonight probably alone i like vanilla mocha is cool too i m not sure what to say to this you do you yeah wow i didn t know my vagina had that power intp female but i relate i have changed within a day and already moving on from where i was not sure if this is a pro or a con sorry for my sudden disappearance i needed some silence istps and intjs seriously give the best advice always a good thing i am aware of ariel being full on esfp but her want of freedom is very much like mine what the meaning of life where do you get your coffee from i either get it from the store and brew it myself o what your favorite planet neptune
intp,your wife yes bullish usdcad for a bounce back to agree yes looks good to me china markets closed sunday through to thursday for golden week spring holiday hk amp singapore markets closed tonight also that is my view too but every time he has said something protectionist the usd has dipped true so far in his very short presidency this is how the market has reacted see what happens tonight but when trump gets protectionist it is usd negative aaah but they are in saudi arabia and they are not banned why today in yemen the us attacked an al qaeda cell of saudi amp yemeni jihadists but only the yemenis are banned from the us why no idea this time thanks so much fab trump muslim ban excludes countries linked to his businesses hi eddy we will cover it for you monarchy protecting monarchy thats because we arent allowed to hear what is happening in yemen and the uk too of hijackers surely there is a country missing fromlist oh wait they have the oil good luck see what it looks like when we get it not convinced we need it thats about to go south again everyone is still long if only i made money lt sigh gt seriously you are too nice x trump press conference in hrs with pm may welllikes it im not quite there yet what the heck no not sure negative rates are good but stable flat inflation expectations are good for households donald cares about donald inflation is theft dont have a clue yes i agree lets see tomorrow i agree it is entirely possible but i would be surprised i would be surprised bon chance i agree v bad news for ontario i agree it is a valid pattern if we can break out of the channel needs some usd weakness though i agree its all a disaster good luck the peso is chunky ticks too has been wild i dont see how he can tax cars made in mexico and not canada he cant just scrap nafta with mexico and not canada the short peso i think that trade is almost done they build a lot of cars and vans in ontario north atlantic free trade agreement we voted leave because of immigration allegedly and got the person who had been in charge of immigration for the last years yep great britain is going to join chart wise is great will put it on the list for next week again will do it on tmrw podcast the way the mxn peso is moving on border tax comments you would think the market had already priced in nuclear wa time to sell cad instead completely agree we looked at in october love it good luck that one sucks for markets and trading though that looks stunning i dont will do one for you later or first thing i look at prem regularly as soon as it looks to be bottoming will buzz you break

intp,thoreau and civil disobedience despite my current state i find this photo of my dog to be very relaxing and it makes me happier i love the irony of this dude says women are naturally less aggressive me is super hyper from too much coffee actually insert short paragraph i drank too much coffee save me it hard for me to explain what he is like in detail but i can say that he is an intp who worked on fe amp manages other doctors now the more mature i get the more i end up like my dad knowing that i think i ll also be less liked by younger intps as this trend continues i mean i believe them to be so radical amp self serving that they could never understand how they are wrong oh no your content has just changed a bit or maybe i m just seeing things that don t exist haha i think if a nazi could understand why they shouldn t believe in genocide then they wouldn t large groups of ppl calling for genocide can get out of control fast i don t think it is an idea worth protecting im not calling for genocide and i ve decided that i think anyone calling for genocide deserves to be punched because he is supporting a group that has called for genocide i take back what i said before that not the same because it easy to imagine that he would do the same thing to the group he hates so much for no good reason i wouldn t punch someone in the face but i m not going to be sad about someone punching a nazi after the fact i think when someone dedicates themselves to hating a group based off of race or religion it very different you in a bad mood everyone thinks their truths are objective so how does one tell the difference by truths do you mean potential subjective realities that few people think about or are aware of am i actually just more alone now than before the real change being that i have become content with it and therefore less lonely i watched youtubers talk about it and referenced my own life i m sure they exist somewhere i disagree it just a way of exaggerating what someone said and it makes conversation difficult wow i m a lot less annoyed with people now also i think i ll try even harder to be nice when i disagree with someone maximize learning looking back at how i was when i was in my ti si loop i didn t realize that was what i was doing at the time it wasn t intentional is straw manning someone argument willful misunderstanding or is it a subconscious reaction to our own vulnerability and uncertainty she wrote both smarter and stronger yeah but a lot of physical jobs use machines now rather than lifting so there isn t a good reason women can t do them and she thinks all men will want to spend more time at work than with their kids and that isn t true either she thinks all women are going to want to be more focused on childcare the way she is that isn t true also she says men aren t complaining but there are groups of men who do some about dumb things amp some about real inequalities of the same things biologically men are no better at certain jobs than women she making inaccurate assumptions for something to be a biological fact it has to be true for all normal members of a given sex men and women are both capable doesn t matter who you hear more from too much as long as one realizes that radicals are outnumbered i view large groups as being a collection of many smaller groups some of which are radical oh i think it was actually kinda funny i mean they laughed about it nicely i m still friends with them i once said that to a group of people and they all just kinda looked at me guess i didn t find my people then here we go again there going to be a lot of protests during the next years whole bc of the few and refuse to see the big picture to me you are an idiotist that is all in almost every group ever there are mixtures of good and bad people and i don t care what you label yourself as if you stereotype the you will immediately be aware of who you are biased towards if you pay attention to which groups you ve stereotyped as radical and violent it was a small portion of the anti trump population ppl set cars on fire over football games smh i know an intj in their ni fi loop how would he get out of it i mean in my own time i study a lot of different things but this is specifically talking about school subjects but if you give me weeks for subjects i will learn very little and struggle the whole time give me one week to study the materials for one subject and i ll learn so much about that one subject someone at walmart thought i was a boy and that i was dating my friend who was with me bc i was buying a bear and valentine day chocolates i think male intps feel less inclined to understand fe and therefore end up with that sort of edgy humor they will grow out of it maybe my infp roommate finds me to be hilarious i think it depends on maturity it more for supporting each other than convincing others i wish more people understood that i have had a few infps like me romantically although i think it would never work because we are too similar in some ways no one would act like that if it wasn t so divided by people thinking it us vs them but sure all leftists are like that if only the entire purpose of this video wasn t to shit on everyone who disagrees with trump or decided to march i ll neglect fe somewhere else for the rest of the night you can tell i m upset bc i totally disregarded twitter etiquette and just retweeted as much as i wanted to sorry about that on the back yeah and unlike most problems it gets worse the more you think about it

intp,it all about the instinct amp intuition just know i do it all within the moment i just flow you got this i am back in rhythm with the flow of the universe i ll never give up always been that way myself try getting into reiki then you know what you gotta do trust your feelings they will all learn one day hopefully i feel you i ve done the same lol you be knowing my dude lmao personally it depends on who i m smoking with am around that tripping though lmao true true if i had to choose a high though it d be the high from a fronto with weed in it same i m king at distracting myself from anything i don t like being high i like the act of smoking haha it actually doesn t help me focus i just say that i m always on twitter when i do homework or i m at school helps me focus you be knowing because i wanted to talk about weed and different drugs affect the chakras differently also because weed is the most used you be knowing then she just wants a spiritual gangster she tired of settling for less lt you already know it and ocean too proud of you to stop smoking or to keep doing it lol there also everything i said in my thread do your googles i noticed you think that you know shit all this shade that coming at me i wonder who throws it i ve been there leaving the room part but now we know indigold souls on the rise this nigga already winning you already in tune fruit gods it all as real as you make it i m bout it drugs dull the senses and make it easier for you to be affected by various energies hence why many ppl get anxious paranoid when smoking forgot to add that weed makes you more open energetically you re more apt to feel ppl around you w out being able to protect yourself you just need to learn to guard your energy weed drops your energetic guards even more so youd basically be feeling others even more than if sober i m just gonna keep cutting it out more and more i cant exactly make tea with my living conditions straight up i agree everything in moderation after all i been cutting down doe i don t do it in the am anymore either so my mind hella clearer i ve known this for like years lmao i just still smoke weed lmao straight up it kinda common sense too like when you get a sugar rush and then crash same happens with the senses i was for her when you were ready to give her up i was on it making missions just to pick her up entirely unnecessary but if you want to go for it go for it then lmao i m gonna work out in like min get synch with me go to sleep pine lmao i ve been laying in bed for hrs time to eat fruit and workout it crazy how far i ve gotten feeling hella blessed if it consistent i ain t bout it i feel like this is long overdue known me and i ve known you too like what ayahuasca or just herbs herbs are not synonymous with drugs same no moar drugs anyways that all i gotta share if you must smoke weed smoke small amounts and or do it inconsistently bless up i m not sure if the astral body gets more tethered in the d or if you just use it more or both but yeah another interesting bit of info when you get high the astral body becomes heavier in use hence the lack of dreams with consistent smoking energetically speaking when you come down from a high the rd eye then goes to having a low amount of energy centered there as well

intp,just realized that that last tweet sounded like clickbait it not it just a long screwed up list i swear trump just told us what his plan is for the first days and i ve never felt so hopeless it baffles me that people can still think climate change is a hoax when it almost mid november and the temperature here in il is f why does every insult or comeback republicans make against democrats end in get a job and the other option was a misogynist bigot who threatened change for the worse they just had to stick with whoever it was because we basically have a two party system what people don t understand is that democrats civilians did not choose to rig the primaries that was the work of the dnc this showed up on my newsfeed and i actually snorted the saddest thing is that the the younger generation future was determined and screwed up by old bigots and racists this person who has no idea what is going on in the world is a serious presidential candidate don t treat me like shit and then expect me to make you feel better when you say you feel bad for treating me like shit be with someone who doesn t just tolerate your eccentricity but values it and joins in did i just find my soul mate told someone how much i think they suck as a person and instead of getting angry with me they agreed and made an effort to be better i m tired of trying to force myself to feel things for people it doesn t work it not the openly dark people you should fear it the happy people who claim to have no dark side people are more interesting and tolerable when just because i pretend not to notice that you are continuously staring at me doesn t mean that you should keep doing it i suppose i should have clarified that i have no idea how other girls think recently gave my friend advice on girls saying just buy them books and feed them pizza because that what would work for me i don t get ads on social media like has anyone ever gone on twitter and been like omg look at those new chips better click this link when people talk to me about art i can go on and on but for some reason as soon as they ask me something personal i forget what words are i should really stop telling people to die to those girls that talk loudly with each other in front of everyone so that you will know how interesting they think their lives are die me there something you need to know before this goes any further my cat always comes first keeps unwavering eye contact shove those emotions down and never let them out at least not here please jk sorta not really it scares me when people i like like me more it makes me wonder what so wrong with them that they have to settle for me guy i like you re so beautiful me ya you re okay does happy dance on inside haha it usually scares people because they are weak my favorite pickup line to use is i want to cling to you like soap to a baby eyes if i feel a constant urge to correct you on everything you say when we speak i will probably stop talking to you rather than correct you he speaks so well yet he types so inconsistently flattery pertaining to my looks will get you nowhere however i m slightly ashamed to admit this flattery pertaining to my art might i like showing people my shitty side first that way when they do see my okay side they won t expect me to be that way all the time i turn my music up to tune you out not because what you say affects me but because it annoys the shit out of you he thought i was joking tinder is stupid btw just going to push down these negative feels with multiple series of books and the first four episodes of game of thrones i wish someone would just slap me when i become melodramatic i will do the same for you wondering if there will ever be a day when i m not constantly told what to do by other people you lost me at god tells us oh sorry i just remembered i had to umm cant think of reason not be here walks away i hate it when drunk me sends touchy feely texts to people and then sober me has to deal with the outcome in the morning i m all for being independent but sometimes i just want someone to take care of me and sometimes i want someone to take care of i become obsessed with things for short periods of time sometimes i cringe at my own awkwardness your voice makes me want to die i don t care if you think you re cute don t interrupt the entire class and try to become the focal point i thought i should clarify don t let anyone convince you that introversion and needing alone time is unnatural or qualifies you as broken be who you are correction psychology issues like i m broken because i dont want to be around people i care about told a guy how sometimes i need to withdraw from everyone and he shouldn t take it personally his response it ok everyone has issues that wonderful moment when you habitually go to stalk that person you always stalk and suddenly realize that you don t care to do it anymore for someone who enjoys simplicity i do sure manage to complicate the shit out of my life don t ask me why i m sad because i don t know i tend to simply remove people from my life rather than deal with them i just tired of charades and drama intp in a fight vs nonintp in a fight we are fighting every fight at once they are fighting one by itself i just feel like you would look better shriveled on the ground realizing your mistakes and feeling only misery there are reasons behind my actions even if you can t understand sorry i wasn t listening i was thinking of ways to kill you the thing about passive aggressive people is that once you finally sink to their level they act like you re the crazy one at least i can always retreat back into my books and mind i find it mentally draining lol never again keeping up multiple relationships is exhausting i don t understand how other people do this i hate when people stare at me like please never look at me again say what you mean but more importantly mean what you say that all i want it just that at night i ve got nowhere to hide when i m alone for too long i can convince myself of anything this is because i don t realize how out of touch with reality i ve become i always get into relationships and they always disappoint i either need to lower my expectations and standards or be content with my cat i hate when people stare at me but then act offended when i make a point of looking annoyed and staring back you call it stalking i call it looking at information that is available online sometimes i m tempted to just ask people their personality type because i can t figure them out how i react when customers hit on me i don t thinking of detailed ways to completely destroy someone emotionally mentally and physically marginally calms me it drives me bonkers but at least i have the fake smile down

about the aca health care is not we re all busy but this simple effective app can help you take small significant action to resist trump just one helluva movie bryan cranston knocks it right out of the park as lbj if you don t understand how the south knowledge is power understand the tactics that the current administration is adept at using defend yourself wrong this man child simply doesn t get it does he donald trump sees each issue as a struggle for dominance for example the coming trade wars those who fall by are you ready to work to age and receive lower social security benefits that the gop plan for your future i hope that the media is going to actually fight back on this and i hope that fighting back means more than we all need to understand this first for those who are confused the affordable care act aca is the same i ll be there hope all can join in it really important to follow up words with strategic actions that the entire senior administrative team from the dept of state just resigned rather than work under a trump got something to say to the potus but you say the official white house call center is down no worries use this climate change us epa everyone joining the resistance should read this let understand that we re in this for the long game and we we are votes away from denying confirmation to betsy devos please tag friends in maine tennessee alaska we cannot say on one hand that trump is the single most dangerous threat to our country while at the same time if you ve got a daughter grand daughter who seems uninspired by school and particularly math science take her let advocate for something that might actually solve the problem of donald dnc needs jerry brown now oh the next four years are going to be really interesting this guy is operating on a completely different lunch at morgan lobster shack in midtown ron had the lobstah mac n cheese and i had the omg surf n turf what we have here is a dangerous unpredictable man child accustomed to getting his own way and vengeful when this is so wrong it hard to know how to get my head wrapped around it shows you how bizarre the gop has in case you missed it the senate voted to to end coverage for preexisting okay peg is right this is very funny indeed snl nails it the march is over and you re probably wondering what to do now here it is got a mammogram and ultrasound today hard to not let your imagination get carried away when they keep wanting to yup journalism just changed and whether it for the better or worse will be up to those in journalism do they oh and you might want to re read this piece by michael moore i posted this back in july and am pretty sure you really really really should read this i m reading it now and although i skimmed the first two sections quelle amusement just so all of my friends know that there is more than the march and for those of you not in reno look up the real issue here is about modernizing elections here in nevada and about the top two bill that doug this is a fascinating look at what just happened here from an outsider in venezuela they had their own wow this interview went right into the ditch kellyanne conway took pushing back to a new low as a trained what being said about trump in other parts of the world here an excerpt from a friend in france that i got thanks for this amazing photo bob tregilus sorry we didn t meet up nice at least to know that the russians are thrilled about his inauguration just hung up phone st mary calling to confirm that yes my insurance will cover a routine mammogram but here the inaugural stump speech tomorrow at the womens march in reno i suggest we adopt this fired up ready to go so it seems like most of us are on the right side of events by boycotting the inauguration i stopped listening to keith olbermann quite a while back but this is worth listening to he making a very yeah challenging the backcountry when there are epic but seriously unstable amounts of snow can sound like a this short book should be a fascinating look at how we might best approach this mess complete with best join please listen share join the resistance movement wow here we go again needless perhaps to say but we re in up to our ears in a lot of this i ll be participating in the women march on saturday a m downtown reno anybody interested in and she can t answer a straightforward question go bernie go another massively unqualified cabinet pick has never worked in public education wants to do away with public why has the gop long fought obamacare it complicated mostly because it the very same plan that they i support the members of congress who are boycotting the inauguration particularly important to know if you are taking part in the women marches too bad we can t have this

enfj,looks like i finally have a bridge between the internet and the commodore the sdiec drive been really impressed with pokémon go here back home lots of rarer pokémon showing up this was tonight great fi about we get off the train at the first stop in massachusetts heading back to western mass for thanksgiving courtesy of able to go door to door on foot no rental car required took a little break from reading tweets for a few weeks was a nice break but glad to be back again i don t get excited about vr overall not very useful for me but i could see myself playing with google street view on it for hours on end i must be doing something wrong with the daydream view i can t get it to comfortably fit on my head the strap is very awkward daydream view it like google cardboard but it actually works looks like i missed the window to get that keyboard wrist rest yeah let us know when you re going to be here in the city and we can figure out the logistics the keyboard is different but i think easier to type on as far as the touch bar goes i d forgotten about this game for the commodore until i ran across it tonight used to play lemonade for hours no reservations now that i have it in hand i m very happy about my decision to get it the following emojis are brought to you courtesy of the new macbook pro touch bar new mbp arrived today still migrating so only got to use it briefly but already i welcome our new usb c thunderbolt and touch bar overlords how can you still have a bad day after seeing this there were so many great commodore programmers in the who really knew machine language and could work magic with k which turns out to be good because the hardware just got all goofy five minutes ago and wouldn t boot in all fairness it years old the mac has excellent emulators for commodore hardware this actual hardware is only for those times when the emulator isn t enough i m just sitting here staring at that screen listening to the hz buzz from the monitor and basking in all the childhood memories got the disk drives datasette and waiting on sd drive yes an sd drive for a c need cassette tapes and floppies now i never had a commodore before you basically get three systems in one c c and cp m with the how exciting ebay is a real gamble sometimes but i ve managed to luck out finding a commodore and commodore monitor both in fantastic condition finally got the last piece this morning to get this system working i can t begin to express the happiness this bri wgn should work that what we have on but seriously that so sad i don t know how tech workers there tolerate that pedestrian hostile environment walking is dumb you should have a rental car for crossing the street to get to the strip mall like a normal american knowing me you can probably figure it out ordered my friendcalls it the iphone minus it wasn t and there weren t basic was simple but cryptic i needed a teacher to help me through some concepts before it clicked if you ve never heard of a c or never had one watch this video it worth it just for the ness of it and it really makes you appreciate how raw computers and the data they work on really are and how underneath the covers there is no magic i have a new respect for the c it was a device that a person could actually grasp from the software all the way down to the chip but the best part has been rediscovering an old friend that you can now have a meaningful adult conversation with and truly appreciate found great books emulators software and cartridge images i ve just been blown away by the dedication to commodore so many years later spent the week poring through archived issues of compute gazette which in hindsight was some really high quality material for its time so i decided to fix that and start relearning the c what a difference years and google makes to find answers to your questions for years i ve always had regret about not understanding how the commodore and all of those programs in compute gazette worked it wasn t until my senior year in high school while taking a basic programming course that it all finally clicked and i really grasped it i got my commodore for my th birthday i loved playing and tinkering with it but sadly i never really learned how to program it my parents sent me a package of my childhood things from the last week among them was this little treasure this is some kind of trick right hasscolded you yet i finally found a practical use for my pixel c android tablet i pre ordered two of them yesterday but this still gave me a good laugh sheep view that bah ah ah ah ah d my availability to work on contract ios android projects has shifted from the beginning of october to mid october that feeling never goes away the more you learn the more you realize you don t know still pretty impressive looking did you take that with an iphone this has happened to me too it been over two months since pokémon go has been released and from what i saw atthis past week it still going strong someone yelled hey there a chansey over here and literally people started running over to the spot as fast as they could spent a few hours atplaying pokémon go today with hundreds of other people can t believe the crowds and all the pokémon there i d say my first week playing pokémon go was pretty productive corporate mathematics why should i spend hr on one developer when i can get for hr well times still equals

enfp,istj the one in the room constantly accomplishing things enfp the one connecting amp making sure everyone happy w what being accomplished no resolutions only celebrations this year learning to celebrate amp embrace the space my life fills crazy messy or wonderful it all me enfpresolutions yearly illusions that a new year will change our ability to plan execute amp succeed let alone remember what we resolved to do to absorb the energy of all those i know and love is completely and utterly exhausting my idea of cleaning is more of a gathering amp dumping of piles from many rooms into designated hidden areas i often fill others lives with positive affirmations while trying to quiet the internal chatter in my head of negative insecurities i ll politely smile when you show me the polished surface of your life amp soon i ll be asking about the dustiest corners of your reality enfps can t balance their checkbooks very well but they can balance the emotions of about close friends at the same time not i want people to connect with me but i also need time away love me love my space what a peaceful day it would be to blindfold myself from seeing all sides of every problem every feeling and every outcome if you re an enfp there a good chance someone has lied to you about the actual time something starts just to get you there on time it not that enfps are never running early it just that when we are we feel like we have time to do something on the way then we re late an enfp ability to sum up a situation correctly in a short amount of time is sometimes even shocking to them at work enfps can often be the go to for those seeking support amp empathy be wary of energy consumed from being an emotional dumping ground checks phone messages work related from friend saying do you have time to talk no question which one i respond to first enfps can feel overextended when their drive amp energy creates a leadership role but their preference is to be equal amp explore together enfps search for perfect gifts a gift card just seems too impersonal then we take forever deciding run out of time amp buy a gift card to reveal so much of my soul that others always see the real me my ultimate goal and my ultimate fear enfps try so hard to make the best holiday for everyone else it is our joy but should not be at the expense of our own enjoyment i can make a decision quickly if it involves various paths it easily changed amp i can go back if i don t like it enfps spend a lot of time living life and then recovering from life enfps are never just hearing the words you say we are connecting the subtleties behind the words amp searching for how you really feel journeys are much more interesting to me than conclusions laundry istj finds an unmatched sock searches for where it may be enfp adds single socks to previous pile in room finds a match enfp in public enfp alone we solve emotional crime scenes on the daily why did he make that face is she sad he seemed disappointed that moment when you say something amp no one responds so you keep explaining what you said but still there silence i hate that moment you either love us for our overly passionate empathic nature or hate us for our overly passionate empathic nature enfps are quite the perceptive personality we see through so many defense mechanisms amp passive aggressive ways that it difficult to trust amazing how a quiet morning recharges this extrovert i bounce off the energy of others so much it refreshing to be still enfps can disappear from your life when trying to juggle too many things at once we constantly shift our priorities so we ll be back soon enfps can benefit from a temporary flexible volunteer job helping others is usually the best thing for our self esteem i often give energy to something and crash with energy left things are rarely with me forever editing my wordiness of emotions when composing work emails me daily i once apologized for my messy house by blaming it on my p ness strangest looks ever an enfp can be so lost in a good conversation they will often jolt up in a panic saying wait what time is it i totally forgot to looking in the cushions of the couch for the remote you just lost and finding the cordless phone you lost months ago probs because i never make firm plans for the day my day can be quickly consumed by those who do this i wait to see how i feel about so many things before i make a decision that it overwhelms me and i basically never decide i will jump through hoops to help a friend but show me an online return policy with steps and i won t take the time to return something this was like free therapy i can tell you anything chances are if you are an enfp you ve heard this more than once i am exhausted after a social event because i m constantly assessing how things are going what i said how others are reacting etc i get irritated if i have too many things to do in a day yet i start amp not finish many projects at a time enfps don t excel at short conversations we will walk back to a conversation with one more thing i forgot to tell you over amp over again enfp in a group text friend hi friend hello friend hi me texting privately everything ok how are you really doing i have such a hard time turning people down that my no often sounds like a maybe it hard to have something you love about your personality reflected back as too sensitive or dramatic as an enfp i m so happy you like what i have to say i read negative meaning into words that are not extreme if you say fine ok or yeah i will assume something not quite right i have a silent project wave challenge going on w my neighbors it is my goal to get them to wave back don t just agree with me to agree with me i want you to passionately reflect on things i say amp challenge me to see things in a new way if we are talking with someone who has nothing in common with us enfps start to dig we will use humor or insight to find a common ground enfps do buy birthday cards we just put them aside until we can add a meaningful note then forget to send them intuitive people watching i m always finishing big projects myself because i don t want to put people out or don t plan far enough in advance to ask for help you are right when it comes to brainstorming about what could be i do that but am very bad at planning amp organizing ahead enfps are good at living in the moment we forget too much to live in the past amp we re often too unorganized to focus far into the future because we are able to read what people need enfps usually want the same in return telling people how to meet their needs feels unnatural

enfp,how is trump admin oppressing muslims obama did not allow iraqi refugees for months in it definitely an issue that needs to be addressed that a great question for obama he needs to get on that too you do realize that claim is baseless right he hired jewish people to work at breitbart i always remind people of this image right here gt i really think this is one of the reasons he ran for president he hates seeing discord in his community beyond many ny families white black hispanic and asian have had to give up the pleasure of a leisurely stroll in the park have u seen his plan for urban renewal here obama admitting that voter fraud exists who do you think would be qualified then did you think obama pick julian castro was that wrong but in this letter i see trump screaming out for peace in his ny community the importance of law enforcem yep me too yep carson had a rough childhood yes lived in urban detroit boston he understands the struggles of the inner city this is also a really great thing he did that main stream media refuses to report on he said some things he shouldn t have his actions say otherwise though when dealing w people that also why he appointed dr ben carson to house amp urban development he wants these communities to thrive that a noble thing for a president to act on it unacceptable that many in poor communities are getting shot he kept saying over and over how horrible it is that people are getting shot while walking to grab a loaf of bread he compelled to act in chicago because of how out of hand it is if anything he wants it to stop did u c abc interview again not defending him but just pointing out this is how he talks weird no no he not a christian and he wasn t making fun of the disabled reporter i agree i can t defend his behavior he has not behaved well but i think he hates the fact the so many in chi are getting killed what do you mean by defending justice i only ask because people give it different meaning he not a christian but he is for christian values such as being pro life he is not the racist people peg him to be whoa father let him appoint an unbiased judge devoted to adhering to the constitution no one should believe everything anyone says i m gonna be one of trump harshest critics thanks for sharing it think about all the reports about voting machines not working owned by george soros who wants to destroy the us you have to keep an open mind i wanted dr ben carson as prez but he dropped out this is why we have the electoral college california ny have millions more people who vote dem voter fraud affects both republicans and democrats no one wants a president who won by cheating same thing w state officials here a news article in colorado about it what biased about going undercover hearing people in their own words that not biased so the people were lying i can link to a whole lot more from other states but i think you get the point another dnc official confirming voter fraud more voter fraud with election officials breaking election laws i can just point to videos and news articles there have been many documented cases of democrats registering dead people to vote and so on drink that tart cherry juice why do say it as if it didn t happen evidence shows it happened and even obama encouraged illegals to vote founder margaret sander said the most merciful thing that the large family does to one of its infant members is to kill it obama is most definitely not a christian you re saying that what should be truth on the matter is from cultural background experience that not true so what are you saying the gender norm understanding is for an a a well but race is not the issue gender norms apply to all people regardless of race read the article but not sure how that answers my questions and how is that phrase exclusive to conservative white middle class gender norms has nothing to do w race ok but to call it racially coded really is that a hair magazine isn t biblical manhood and womanhood what we should aspire to how is that phrasing racially coded actually our chief goal is to glorify god if that not first then your marriage and family will suffer plead the promises of god like jacob here the link i posted them all onyou can get all as a bundle i plan on making more too obama is wayyy more of a threat to our democracy than trump love your show dave keep up the good work why yes i am that an exact quote and how do u know i ve not read it interesting only through god kindness that leads us to repentance i guess no telling how widespread though only god knows seems like revival is often coupled w resurgence of sharing gospel what do you think a revival would look like in our generation i can think of some things but how widespread this is so sad who do you think is doing the bombing but chuck this is exactly in line with obama political and religious worldview

entj,anti trump protests taking over the street near capitol hill in washington former top kasich aide gt president trump to cbn i would say that the office is so powerful that you need god even more trump i think brexit is going to be a wonderful thing for your country you are going to have the people that you want in your country trump at press conference as far as again putin and russia i don t say good bad or indifferent i don t know the gentleman trump on mattis refusing to torture i don t necessarily agree but i would tell you he will override because i m giving him that power trump if we could have a great relationship with russia and with china and with all countries i m all for that trump on russia relations as far as the sanctions very early to be talking about that trump says he had a very good call with peña nieto this morning president trump says secretary mattis will override him on using torture and waterboarding i am going to rely on him darn really had a chance for a homerun but i blew it sorry it like the slomo version lol should i repost or a m trump tweets on canceling mexico meeting a m peña nieto cancels meeting the peso this morn no alden i did not sign the letter president trump says onhe will start construction on the border wall as soon as we can as soon as we can physically do it trump tellsonthat taxpayers will be reimbursed at a later date for the mexican border wall on the way to work radio host in middle of political debate on trump says let talk about this keyline pipe thing let be clear trump has alleged millions of actual illegal votes being cast and counted not irregularities on voter registration lists percent of trump supporters said they think voter fraud happens very or somewhat often in an abc post poll in late october author of study spicer cited totoday did the non citizen vote lead to trump popular vote loss no our data doesn t support that dartmouth study the voter fraud concerns fomented and espoused by the trump campaign are not grounded trump lawyers in michigan recount case all available evidence suggests that the general election was not tainted by fraud or mistake national secretaries of state statement we are not aware of any evidence that supports the voter fraud claims made by president trump spicer says trump got the most gop electoral votes since reagan that wrong george h w bush got electoral votes in spicer cites a pew study statistic on voter fraud in briefing it was in it wasn t pew its author said trump is wrong spicer toon millions committing voter fraud the president does believe that based on studies and information he has price on stock trading the reality is that everything that i did was ethical and above board and transparent wow thanks update now i m trying to go to sleep and i feel like i m getting seasick i bought it at cvs guys so i thought i was buying a normal iphone charger but this one lights up when it charges and i m so excited just got off the phone with alan who helped me with a flight voucher code not working and he was awesome just fyi follow the thread ben good question i asked one expect today who just said they would traditionally focus on governing and rnc dnc would raise one of my favorite parts of the day is when you guys go and favorite all my tweets it been hours and i still have thatanimatronic pizza song from snl stuck in my head not snarky he literally wouldn t be able to sell his merchandise at least via a campaign store without filing what he did the reason trump filing matters when your donors give small dollars and don t max out an extra two years can mean a lot more money and just for comparison obama didn t file his re election paperwork until april and george w bush didn t file it until may but for the fec a form what trump submitted is what makes you a candidate so it official trump is now a candidate for potus trump wrote in a note to federal election officials this does not constitute a formal announcement of my candidacy for the election in other news trump filed technical paperwork with the fec for a bid means he can start raising money and keep selling hats hmmmm okay i ll check again when i m back at my laptop thanks beth the google doc i saw was created at pm nah dnc statement calls tillerson next top us diplomat vladimir putin best american friend and kremlin could not have asked for better

says it was million during speech spicer says it unquestionable that trump speech was the most watched inaugural spicer to i think sometimes we can disagree with the facts our intention is never to lie to you and the real cheese people apparently the first press briefing trump in the oval office says new lawsuit alleging emoluments clause violation is totally without merit rubio i will support mr tillerson nomination in committee and in the full senate monday hitting me like lawsuit those business interests are creating countless conflicts of interest as well as unprecedented influence by foreign governments lawsuit filed by citizens for responsibility and ethics in washington in the southern district of new york eisen painter tribe listed federal lawsuit filed saying trump is violating emoluments clause says trump facing countless conflicts of interest getting into work today like alternative moon you mean haha sorry we can t all be alternative law prodigies i already have an alternative law degree soooo president trump we re going to do some great things over the next eight years eight years omg this kellyanne conway sketch on snl right now any conversation about how

entj,training the next generation of altic leaders all chores done by am bc devotional training you are good when we pray and when we offer worship we ought to be aware of the will of god and be willing for that will to be revealed to us benefits of fasting guidance increase grace amp faith power over evil unction in preaching healing power over flesh amp breakthrough my wife had a gift left at our door for her and can t figure out who left it it bothering her so much excellent work whoever you are the christian relies upon the holy spirit to enable him to control unruly desires on occasion he resorts to fasting as an aid the value of fasting lies not in its immediate effect but in the results which flow from its practice to the christian fasting is not a ritual to be indulged in regularly but a source of intimate delight with fasting and prayer by christians there is no ulterior motive since the glory of god alone is the object in view no christian can become victorious and useful if he ignores personal discipline self denial encourages a believer to see the lord as his all in all source of sufficiency a christian is someone who has begun to deny himself and is in the continuous process of the denying himself a selfish person is unable to enjoy the gospel teaching the boys to worship pray soak in his presence and being willing is the work of praying for every man who has taken a step forward to rise early to pray for their family and read their bible are you collecting your kids trophies if so when do you feel is a proper time to get rid of them or pass them along to your adult child the fact is that the christian life of praying does not grow naturally and without nourishment christians are not to retreat and live their lives in a corner far from the gaze of outsiders we are to live as a visible community god begins by working in a people to save them but always with a view to work through them to draw others into the blessing of his covenant god mission is a matter of the presence of the people of god in the midst of mankind and the presence of god in the midst of his people if good news was only written on your christmas card and has not come out of your mouth you re behind on understanding the good news never ending the church is sent by jesus to continue his mission and this sending defines its very nature the son sent the spirit to gather his church together and empower it to participate in his mission mission has it source in the love of the father who sent his son to reconcile all things to himself myth there is no need for mission in the west since it is already christian myth mission takes place on the non western mission field myth the world is divided into the christian west home base and the non christian non west mission field myth missions is a task for parachurch organizations while the church has only a pastoral role the real object of our prayer is the kingdom of god his rule reign and right ordering of all that is wrong make sure to pray cleansing prayers over your home and family tonight may nothing formed against you stand don t carry home others issues praying foras he preaches pmloop campus operating out of fear or approval makes for a miserable life under lived lay hands on your kids today and pray a prayer of missionary call sacrificial giving and endurance in prayer try it see what

as the great example of giving the holy spirit go read luke use it for devo if you stressed out over the meal preparation more than the fellowship you missed the meaning of the table just as most kids in america have desired a present for christmas may we teach our kids to desire the presence of the spirit even more merry christmas may you not race through this day or even the next several days without considering the incarnation of jesus god with us god help us to honor others by listening with our heart and not with our fear what would your priorities be if you were to budget your time atunement to priorities is key and he put all things under his jesus feet eph let minister from this perspective and victory empower not control a prayer for mothers and fathers over their children

at our door for her and can t figure out who left it it bothering her so much excellent work whoever you are the christian relies upon the holy spirit to enable him to control unruly desires on occasion he resorts to fasting as an aid the value of fasting lies not in its immediate effect but in the results which flow from its practice to the christian fasting is not a ritual to be indulged in regularly but a source of intimate delight with fasting and prayer by christians there is no ulterior motive since the glory of god alone is the object in view no christian can become victorious and useful if he ignores personal discipline self denial encourages a believer to see the lord as his all in all source of sufficiency a christian is someone who has begun to deny himself and is in the continuous process of the denying himself a selfish person is unable to enjoy the gospel teaching the boys to worship pray soak in his presence and being willing is the work of praying for every man who has taken a step forward to rise early to pray for their family and read their bible are you collecting your kids trophies if so when do you feel is a proper time to get rid of them or pass them along to your adult child the fact is that the christian life of praying does not grow naturally and without nourishment christians are not to retreat and live their lives in a corner far from the gaze of outsiders we are to live as a visible community god begins by working in a people to save them but always with a view to work through them to draw others into the blessing of his covenant god mission is a matter of the presence of the people of god in the midst of mankind and the presence of god in the midst of his people if good news was only written on your christmas card and has not come out of your mouth you re behind on understanding the good news never ending the church is sent by jesus to continue his mission and this sending defines its very nature the son sent the spirit to gather his church together and empower it to participate in his mission mission has it source in the love of the father who sent his son to reconcile all things to himself myth there is no need for mission in the west since it is already christian myth mission takes place on the non western mission field myth the world is divided into the christian west home base and the non christian non west mission field myth missions is a task for parachurch organizations while the church has only a pastoral role the real object of our prayer is the kingdom of god his rule reign and right ordering of all that is wrong make sure to pray cleansing prayers over your home and family tonight may nothing formed against you stand don t carry home others issues praying foras he preaches pmloop campus

spam me for minutes and other times i don t get a reply days come to think of it i ve never seen the both of you in the same place at the same time over the past days i have succesfully cleaned and put away every piece of clothing that i own this hasn t happened since about you are literally in the middle of nowhere virginia entp wanna hang out now inxx sorry i m really busy entp wanna hang out inxx sry im rly busy entp doesnt ask again for awhile inxx y do they hate me inxx i wish theyd ask again aaaand new entp because anything that follows is subject to interpretation if you wanna just go out and have a really fun time get yourself an esfp friend but then be prepared to sleep off a massive hangover it can get kind of embarrassing sometimes because most people don t understand that we just like to talk yup gonna have to wait until on this one sux but those are the rules just have to think up an appropriate name lol any other entps out there ever have their genuine curiosity for everything and everyone get them into trouble for sending the wrong signals thinking about changing my and just tweeting mbti stuff when people are kind of mediocre at something and they act like they re a celebrity lol estp what are you doing entp you know i rly haven t figured that out yet estp i meant right now not your life entp you would it was me and i was right a guy with two first names just beat the seahawks life too short to not go for broke psa never go to a xxtj for emotional support you re welcome at least i know that i don t know always thinkin that you know every little thing there is to know but you don t really know ya know do you not let any men sing in bring me to life because that one dude let you fall off the side of a building back in over my last games i am with katarina and with everyone else i suck at typing because my brain is already several steps ahead of the thought my fingers are just now receiving i frequently stop myself mid rant to argue my own point to myself entp this can work st we do this and then that then that estj this is overwhelming i m a step at a time person entp don t i know it i often struggle with thinking i m an se dom until i hang out with one lies i don t even understand it most of the time hemlock tea is the best i drink it ever day and pour a lil out for my boy socrates i simultaneously know everything and nothing don t tell me it not possible psa just because you feel misunderstood doesn t mean you re an infj thank you carry on so you re nice to ppl cuz you might be able to use them to your advantage in the future the ones who are loudest about how hard it is to figure them out are out of times the most shallow and simple people thinking someone is a piece of shit trash human but also acknowledging that their environment played a role are not mutually exclusive ideas i wish i hadn t read this tweet when you ve known someone for years but you re just starting to realize they re attractive asf because you decided to pry into their mind right i think they re far more attractive than infj those compatibility charts are whack

entp,tfw you come up with viable interesting costume ideas but it already all saints day there must be some way out of here said the joker to the thief timeless lyrics sure but particularly relevant in sugarland by story prodigal sugar mill heir meets spirited hostel owner whentries to reconcile details in his testimony nothing is true everything is permitted indeed newby me on rogues gallery empire city mobs vs a disruptive new crime sharing gt seasonal alt right online portal gt dox anti christmas sjws gt rant about cucks who oppose yuletide carols in september gt jose mari chan i wonder how vogonpoetry might sound just as well it probably better that i don t know i quite like my eardrums thanks can a metaplot evolve into a plotterfree at level i guess one way to answer that would be an it style sequel with the group meeting in the present day as thirtysomethings anderson paak ganern inwords daesh from above somebody still loves you boris johnson and you will know us by the trail of debt drug personalities i love you but i ve chosen austerity waiting for the inevitable if a human centipede wore pants meme my belated meandering response to this statement if there one image that epitomizes my fb feed right now it would be mar roxas and duterte challenging each other to a lightsaber duel actually it would only be fair to have mark d manalo vintendo and maybe a returning kt team up against apocalypse at terminus silent rage was solid but silent trickster really won me over hope he sticks with this playfully menacing approach imabayashi has gyardos level ring skills but the charisma of a magikarp took an overbooked finale to get the crowd to pop for him troll maxx in the jdl shirt is best maxx the look on his face while feigning concern was priceless ang mortal enemy ni idol ng the network wellness policy what are in those supplements anyway also applies to pro wrestling arguably when you like the magician you believe all his tricks vintendo seems green in the ring but he totally owns his gimmick he won the crowd even if he was fed to apocalypse gg indeed can t imagine mr sy being ok w apocalypse laying out non wrestler staff hope we get an update re fines disciplinary actions vip vip vip so mark d manalo is now the bonifacio to jdl rizal and bombay suarez gen luna a potent mix comedy chain wrestling puso i wish we could get ralph title shot out of the way in favor of a leo dmanalo rematch mark dm legit working man main eventer so basically saitama is deadpool for weeaboos now okay become a geopolitical superhero like or make art out of it this message was paid for by the good intentions paving company to use a different niche framework has always been chaotic netural hence the crude brenda slurs i lied remember she been a tweener at least since she defended erap she at big show or kane levels of allegiance switches and even if they don t need a lot of money they re usually time intensive as fuck le sigh urgent call by rome is not a town not actually atribute act but you could have fooled me that was quite the heel turn mds kinda guess it was coming these pro wrestling comparisons just write themselves really sigh yeah of phl politics maybe crowd fave part time nostalgia act who delivers on the mic but not worth the top spot punyeta heh point taken re electoral politics pro wrestling comparisons announcing her candidacy feels like a money in the bank title shot cash in nuisance political candidate orwrestling gimmick now seems like a valid game makes it harder to takeseriously having said that i took pains to avoid turning my pinoy mra character into a generic misogynist straw man men rights activist but in practice it usually bitter socially awkward guy blaming feminism for his own loneliness forget it all the bands i wanted to see at played early apparently sigh maybe i ll go after midnite for fools and foes for the pinoy context it not one specific resource it from actively reading the comments on thefb group but after researching actual posts from filipino mras guys who seriously internalize beta uprising i see how toxic it gets personally i get the misguided nice guy pov so it wasn t hard to write a hopefully plausible pinoy mra type antagonist for the alleged motive for the beta revolt is painfully close to stuff from mystory may the victims find justice i have no idea what you re talking about we put it in my player and it worked just fine remember you can be so absent minded okay i m officially excited to read her plot summary at the very least most definitely gave me plenty to consider i ve got an upcoming zine directly related to many themes from the movie damn you autocorrect yes i know how dre and eazy e should be spelt thanks tofor organizing the screening the core easy e ice cube drew dynamic brotherhood loyalty ego checking is a case study indynamics from themes to period aesthetics echoes shouldn t be any less relatable to pinoy viewers imho pern w a mastered the man game lawyering arms money braggadocio a black mirror held up to us capitalism so far so cavalier re firearms for all the rights based rhetoric it matter of factly backed by loaded guns frames n w a rise to fame as creators learning to be entrepreneurs refreshingly honest re how much image matters so farhas been the kind of grim stylizedtale that drawn niche pinoy crowds since bernal brocka mins in dre as dream chasing deadbeat artist kitchen sink family drama so why isn tgetting a cinema run here at a private screening of hella frenetic opening set piece really a battering ram but hey it got my attention realization myplot kinda feels like a homage to my nd faveep dead things well minus the tech wizardry and demons gah myconcept has so much backstory it feels like i m plotting a standalone sequel a la silence of the lambs or freak there also the challenge to make it seem possible that a crime like this would happen at all believable circumstances are key it kinda liberating to write an unlikely crime in the phl setting because there no precedent in readers minds buuuut huge realization i plan to write about a crime that has literally never happened in the phl at least not in this context until i read the parenthetical note my head voice read that with basic college student vocal fry rather than pro tooled autotune writing tips based onseason mistakes useful for valid for all kinds of storytelling admittedly it may not be the wisest thing to bring that up right after i at mentioned interpol but whatever so i ve decided to pre order wonderland at normal price but also source a ahem buccaneer advance copy to read beforestarts
entp,let go ghana okay then okay on the contrary the left wing is loud and ineffective the right is silent and powerful that how they won presidency lol i guess we will see a world war outcome in these times quite frankly would require a major international incident lol now that you ve brought that up they fought because countries were invaded and people were killed not for good terms being working terms so we are saying the same thing china gains nothing from a conflict with a country that owes them as it stands trump is on good terms with the only two countries that can start a world war vs america russia and china that wasexactlywhere i was going until two major super powers have a go there can t be a world war led i think you are losing track of the topic of our discussion authoritarian governments don t cause or build u the world will not kill each other because we don t like trump or his style of government his chosen policies etc like bruh to so quick the world will fight because we don t like trump have you considered perhaps this approach is the reason things like trump brexit keep happening nobody wants to c lool right my apologies i didn t anticipate that my indulgence in a debate about your projection on world affairs would lead america hasn t made moves that requires violent intervention no world war started without excessive force so it lol world war nah maybe an american revolution but a world war there no international incident yet intro to adulting stupidity whoever came up with the names for french numbers gave up after just started mixing stuff sixty ten four twenty four twenty lmao she said untouched wells but i can agree with that if she into you she will become entertainment you re an average of your closest friends when boring people hang around interesting people they slowly get more interesting over time somebody has to be the interesting one they have started doing gospel trap meh if it is like the dot com bubble it fine we can t have another housing one though hey proverbs read like a nigerian father talking to a child about to end up in mcdonald intro to adulting credit cards what a goal mothers are more clutch than kobe average at best pep gotta apologize to hart and his village for this possession and still soundly beaten teenagers are using pep guardiola to score first club goals that is a dream start he scored on his debut alonso my haters are my motivators for perfect combination for my fantasy intro to adulting my debts update i bought my house too early lol actually i learned because i filed myself i also get maximum returns by myself every year taxes are essential to learn so today i learned how tax credits work and how carry forwards affect each why i lost in the process that an expensive lesson lool the money is there it seeing them that is the problem the shift life is rough aii i wish you good luck sha call me for jollof rice we dey ground it not as hype as you think fam who did you scam i mean ask this time so there no water in the building everyone can go home intro to adulting my money thank you kash and i go way back fam amen sir we are looking to god lol when you re about to retweet a popping tweet but you have to first check their profile in case they trash i think i will write a post tomorrow about my two years adulting so far on this we can all agree speaking of if you have aspirations to purchase a house three things after your purchase first time buyer credits term insurance a will we thank our god nearly figures sir lol i ought to be there within the decade following my projections i will share my experience maybe even contribute for you in my opinion it is your job to legally pay as little tax as you can so home buyer credits donation credits tuition credits use them

entp,sunny weather when will the eu collapse around people a minute are signing a petition to ban president trump from making a state visit to britain so sad to hear john hurt has died fantastic actor and brilliant as winston smith in nineteen eighty four that true are you a foot fetishist piers the bbc needs on screen subtitles whenever diane abbott speaks because i don t understand bollocks what in your opinion constitutes a good trade deal with the us has trump told you what he might offer nearly every tv commercial in the usa is for over the counter drugs that never happens in the uk thank goodness for the nhs yeah ensure the proles tune into your propaganda channel of choice i thinkshould invoke particle and teleport himself back to the it obviously not fascism if someone is unwilling or unable to defend their stance in a free and fra one of the quirkiest b sides i ve come across on youtube maybe it could be the uk entry for he dented your precious ego that what this is really about you and donald trump are like twins y my new wheelie bin grammar is rubbish delete your account heaven forbid that snapchat become a rival to the sun relax corbyn got the upcoming by elections and the next general election in the b where the like button gone from your facebook page most labour constituencies voted to leave it like the game you lose every time you remind yourself that donald trump is pr nailed it the million pound salary has nothing to do with it then one of the world worst insults is surely being called a piers morgan what worse being stuck in a comma or an apostrophe correction in history i d love to remember where and when i stepped into this weird parallel universe we re all locked inside a mike judge movie it like being on a bad weed trip and it getting worse he right you know if trump thinks he above being scrutinised and held to account then he can think again she should pull his trousers down and snigger at his tiny penis sowing the seeds of world war bit nippy on pluto also it would take nearly hours to send a tweet new zealand has always felt like an attractive alternative it also one of the most unlikely countries to be nuked padlocking the fridge london protest i ain t seen a single banner or sign denouncing islamic countries treatment of women yet but i ll keep my eyes peeled with just words the whole world jolts forward into a new age nigel trump doesn t need to stir the eu into oblivion italy banks are going to that eu gone in oh my was absolutely hilarious free movement has been a disaster for the working class across europe but especially here in britain the eu isn t even the present it been paralysed since june and gdp percentage growth is the main measure of economic performance yo one of the few economists who correctly predicted events over the last period of time ttip has already been squished by the incoming us administration jim mellon explains why the euro and eu are failing currency fluctuations happen all the time it not an indicator of economic performance we trade with non eu countries as part of the eu and there not even a trade deal best performing economy in the eu low unemployment low taxes i don what the alternative valiantly cling onto the eu sinking ship and be dragged down when it sinks ben there are far more benefits to leaving a failing system than staying in there are more countries outside the eu to trade with than inside it the single market is an outdate andrew neil seems to be wearing a new brillo pad on his head for mind blown i wouldn t be surprised if trump agreed to review the papers he would figuratively and probably literally rip them to shreds i ought to get my google account password tattooed on my hand because i can never remember it is it possible to do real time stereo monitoring with the scarlett i i ve got l amp r inputs but monitoring is mono worth remembering that nhs and education in wales managed by labour everything made in wales now including that ident brilliant using garlic puree in lieu of onions in your sandwich makes it inedible oh i don t care if i came across as rude or whatever i m sure it gave you a little thrill but keep on point i don t even know what point you re trying to make anymore my original point is was that obama is a hypocrite there you go againreflecting what you really are in your comment i called you a twat i could have also called you deluded stupid race baiting and ignorant but didn t if that the route they re taking how long before the guardian is banned from facebook you blatantly implied i m racist so don t try to wriggle out of it i m happy to debate facts not slurs fyi i deplore identity politics racism xenophobia and the sheer lack of any coherent argument from the left what the hell has the kkk got to do with my point are you really as stupid and deluded irl as on twitter i stand for plenty of things probably far more than you so anyone who is a freethinking libertarian like me is automatically a troll please keep going this is hilarious what a trump account what does that even mean i disagree you clearly are a fool but don t worry your safe space is that way is that it i point out an irrefutable fact and you run away trump won because of people like you not russians or aliens because this is the same cia which said iraq had weapons of mass destruction government lies which led to m innocent deaths a link to a news article reporting what is essentiallyuntil any evidence is presented as yet no evidence sorry what this got to do with my point about interfering with elections or are you floundering for a pov where the evidence of the russians hacking as for evidence of obama interfering with british democracy look on youtube influence the eu ref by making a threat that we d be back of the queue you re missing my point obama is pissed off coz the ruskies hacked dem emails and influenced election but he tried to

entp,jesus was an immigrant carolina loses kentucky loses and duke wins what a good day they listen to country music every day at my work bad news i hear the same songs times a day worse news it growing on me still not sure how this hasn t gone viral yet ah the fickle culture of twitter so technically he has personalities has the most complete worship album in the past years the best don t me lol god will give you rest if christians would focus on jesus as much as donald trump we could accomplish a lot of things romans the grass is not greener on the other side it green where you water it work hard at what important in your life forgiveness comes from confession and repentance to god healing comes from confession and repentance to other people i am fully convinced when you die and don t know jesus you either go to walmart or the dmv headed to the dmv today pray for me saints thank you jesus just as i am i come hallelujah oh what amazing love you have a full tank of grace today god mercies are new and we can walk in that you are forgiven and loved pretty cool that we get fsu at home that ll be fun god allows things we would never allow because he knows what it will accomplish in his story if we were to write our own stories they would be pretty safe and boring always going our own way but god story is so much better i wonder if country artists go into the studio and say hey you know those other guys on the radio that how i wanna sound pain is a part of the process that god uses as preparation for your purpose don t hate the pain embrace it it all in the plan i now use etcetera after every thing i say god doesn t give us grace because we deserve it he gives us grace because he good you don t have to be a slave to fear any longer you are a child of god are you really trusting god today his plan is much better than yours don t just say you trust him really live like it thanksfor being so customer friendly and helpful when issues come up you got me for life i was years old when you were in th grade please refer to other tweets tatum you moron but if there is anyone that can choke it nc state lol state hasn t won in cameron since and we gave it away smith jr is a beast tho tatum is good but he gets on my dang nerves why is grayson shooting when he from deep what in the world duke is gonna give this game away if we re not careful the world worst professional athlete is still better than any one sitting on their couch the grace of god goes beyond our understanding comprehension empathy sympathy and knowledge let extend it that way foundation hope new hello preach it preacha there nobody quite like love you bro you make me better moral excellence gt knowledge gt self control gt patient endurance gt godliness gt brotherly affection gt love in view of all this make every effort to respond to god promises peter nlt it not enough to believe the promise respond truth sin will always take you further than you wanna go keep you there longer than you wanna stay and cost you more than you wanna pay god gives you his grace for the valley and for the mountaintop but his grace shines the brightest in the dark when god does something so drastic in your life and his grace is the vehicle he uses you get a completely different perspective one thing i ve learned about myself is that i love to talk about the grace of god but suck at showing it and receiving it it easy to talk about the grace of god when you know you need it but you can stand on the grace of god when you have received it what if god preparation comes packaged as pain and in that you find purpose in the pain my zeek is doing the same incredible moment i ve seen you move you move the mountains and i believe i ll see you do it again i think people who use grace as a license to sin doesn t understand grace grace is freely given ephesians matty iceeeeeee them duke boys got some good call coach lets go best kept secret stoked i m thankful god grace doesn t have perimeters or conditions on it it would be a trip for god to say i ll give you grace but i swore this was gonna go viral when i posted it lol oh well split was dope bruhhhh hands down one of the most awkward things on tv ever

entp,pleasewe meed to impeach this man be sure to donate to theif you canis matching up to just dm or tweet receipt turn to just dmd receipt thanks for matching i know firsthand because my husband was from the uk and that was in the us already charges to immigrate without a lawyer people who have green cards are here legally theyre also call permanent residents hugs feel better im not neutral i support the womans right to choose and to have the legal right to have a safe medically supervised abortion bans the move complete get rid of is there even no you want to appeal the decision thats why we fight for all or nothing see heres the thing its legal allowable amp while id support a week limit over an outright ban once you talk week limit intelligence is the ability to hold two opposed ideas in mind at the same time amp retain the ability to function see your wrong i have strong opinions on protecting a childs life but my decision is to be pro choice prochoice doesnt always mean pro aborition amp thats what pro lifers seem to not understand i dont have to agree to be pro choice how is that too not one sided and by choosing the child youre denying the mother so i have a miscarriage at weeks i killed my baby my body did it last werk it would have been ok for you to decide to have an abortion this week we are sorry to say youll have to deliver how are you seeing the mothers right if yoire telling her she can and cant so something sorry we caught this at weeks and im choosing to stand by the women if that means i am choosing to be pro her life ao be it no seriously why do you think you can tell me what to or not to do with my or other womens bodies love ya see heres the thing it doesnt matter what i believe my opinion choice has no business deciding for her no im not too much can happen after weeks and again my opinions have no business in a woman choice thats why its prochoice see thats the problem a ban has no exceptions women should have a choice my personal opinion should have no influence over her when does the line get crossed that taking birth control also isn t evil youre also saying its evil to take plan b ad who knows if an eggs been fertilized yet so its evil for a women to take a pill to end a week pregnancy youre saying a woman had no right to decide what she does with her body to something if not within her couldnt exsist survive and why is it ok for you to spend hours in this area when you know the issue is limiting abortions below weeks you wont find a doctor in a hospital that wouldnt deliver if its not medically needed thats why theres laws regarding this a again a full term childis not really the issue amp you know it b if a doctors agrees medically needed yes hippocratic oath and thats ultimately the difference you feel you should be able to tell them no i feel its none of my business its not dodging if is determind by a doctor amp the mom agrees its the best action is to terminate i have no rights in that room so you agree then with the laws that women who have a miscarriage should be prosocuted yes i am very well aware and you and i both know late term abortions are already illegal in most states so thats not the issue lets be real this is a scenerio that would require a obgyn decion to do you re making assumptions that a its healthy b a doctor would perform an abortion vs delivery at weeks on a health child they aren t individuals for the same reason you arent convicted of murder if you hit a car of a pregnant woman amp she miscarries whos being extreme now amp yes if the choice is made i support the decision of the mother and doctor that have made that decision sure i concede that point but you too must see those had to do with control over others amp overturned due to individual rights mudering a child is something external to their body im pro choice because you have the right to do what you want to yourself and heres the main thing pro choice advocates for women to control their own bodies aka what is in amp attached to their bodies a constitutional right does not have to be written into the constitution simply legally protected by the constitution because if you kill someone legally it can be murder or manslaughter or not a crime in self defense all are legally different its a constitutional right just like owning a gun and free speech ps there were cases roe v wade and doe v bolton um no because there are laws against murder that is an insane argument legally and for decades both are different so and i do hear your statments and if a women chooses not to have an abortion i support her its pro choice for a reason again a mother life goes beyond life and death no limitations i follow the law i support the right to choose a exactly which is why under the due process clause of the th amendment a decision to choose to have an abortion is the law your missing point entirely pro choice means supporting women to choosethe choice is individual and only for them to make

infj,its not like they have proper living conditions threw out the muslim world for so many yes to just call in sick take a sick day off from work feb lefties leaving out critical explanations why so many muslim immigrants coming to the usa its not all about liberty freedom agreed muslim countries are encouraging making as many babies as possible its a muslim immigration invasion many atheists deists have been martyred in saudi arabia for being atheists lets do a my main reasons for banning saudi there wahhabism teachings threw outthere region treating women like second citizens the left needto increase votes on the ground but a largerpicture muslim immigration is a strategic invasion of the usa i would prefer to just ban saudi arabia but gong by the numbers of muslim immigration is it truly usa problem muslim immigration is filled with propaganda by the left nothing to do what going on as larger picture of world affairs its muslim immigration invasion due to muslim countries making to many babies not the usa problem or tellthose muslim countries stop having so many babies sounds about right from what i observed this past year lol i don t see myself returning to my old easy going ways because of last years one sided pandering beginning in march usurping laws are becoming the norm over the people and lands i fully support anot a since in saudi they murder atheists and secularists that terrorism even drug addicts are in love with certain types of drugs not much difference in addictive relationships plus iran and other muslim countries make way to many babies on purpose its a strategy soros saudi arabia muslim nations wants to destroy the usa i have but not becoming that person that is a addictive person with a little erratic behavior i don t talk about it as well when your getting high around one person and when not around that person you become low that addictive behavior with toxic i agree i don t get off on being setup around hotties more so wanting to prove a point but yes i do flirt but not as much muslim immigration into the usa is a strategic move to destroy the republic its not about freedom and liberty muslim countries that encourage making more babies so to increase muslim immigration to the west usa that why hey whatz happening duddette the best way is stop over thinking issues causes worries then causes anxieties eat chocolate and ice cream instead watch movie be strong belief in yourself and don t allow others to influence into bad addictive behaviors addictive traits can be controlled otherwise a future of addictive behavior relationships is the horizon i do understand but the fantasy or ideal change will happen most likely will not happen addictive behavior trait maybe its time to cut away addictive behaviors in you life with them its like they egg you into addictive behaviors is the escape place for escaping from being honest in the moment or escaping toward fantasy ask what type of behavior are you work toward a enlighten behavior in all relationships not addictive behavior why are so many muslim countries paying for the protests in the st place save secularism sounds good what if they even win bigger merv post apocalyptic sci fi short film france is become a islamic state usa needs to resist this since foreign states are aiding this muslim migration be a lot more indians today if there wasn t immigrants at all this nation would be empowered by pagans i wonder how will the stock markets respond to theon monday time for trump to pull out a executive order to ban all toys in the usa they ll just use food and energy gasoline electricity to keep us under control amazing how many shady people are entering the usa right at the moment of the saudi arabia putting out supportthe saudi within the usa are most likely the one funding to incite unrest and protests at thi the ten year cycle of boom to bust is a little overdue just like most of the usa bills are overdue want to send potato and sweet potato to not going to happen to many people stocks for retirement went threw the roof since trump took office money talks those numbers are false its more like we are the and the some of over will be watching the super bowl nextweekend when socializing is like a uphill battle even to just say hi i ll stop all together don t like the feeling of doing something wrong thissupports building that type of wall hottie in a lingerie nightie have a relaxing sleep no science no news no competition science majors in college no science govt gigs for the next to years plus they don t understand personal space especially around women girls i would prefer a chocolate filling with blueberry don t think there made yet not sure of a raspberry filling either i won t doubt saudi students in the usa is funding for inciting violence and protests against muslim ban wolfs in the hen house saudi arabian nationalists inside the usa funding to incite unrest and protests saudi arabai nationalists going to college inside the usa are funding and pushing thisprotests ban saudi arabia support aandwill support itthink aggressive and assertive please only burn saudi arabian flags alt right won t stop you they might even join you please only burn saudi arabian flags by burning saudi arabian flags to protest against bombing yemen i think of chocolate with cherry fillings lol

infj,this is me to a t i can find anything on social media if you ever need to talk or need someone to listen feel free to message me i love you all hatred should never ha it is not okay what president trump is doing with his executive orders he does not accurately represent my country should i write end of the semester project on i have more than two friends and i m not sure what to do me i made a bunch of plans on my day off and i kind of want to cancel them infp i understand the feeling i d just use the time to sleep i m so happy to be home just bought me pizza for dinner and gave me a cookie don t tell anyone but entjs do care i m really sorry about that that must have hurt i hope you find your people wherever they might be me so a couple came into work that adopted dogs cats amp horses knowing people like them exist made me happy so i wanted to share it i d like to say this impulse has passed and i m content to stay at home with tea a good book and silence me except i m female but i m looking for a fulfillment that comes no matter where i am or who i am with a reassurance that happiness is reachable because i like the affirmation that comes when i m told i did a good job i like being with people and knowing that it is a safe place i try to make myself available to other people by doing everything right and showing up when they need me and looking to help supposedly the most attractive people are happy that doesn t come naturally to me should i change who i am to be more acceptable to you i m scared of rejection when i show you what a broken and sad human being i am being happy is the hardest thing for me to achieve i m gonna have to find some cake then this is an excellent alternative hahahah that honestly sounds like the safest option rn don t tempt me ever get the impulse where you want to dance in bars with strangers get wasted and screw up every relationship in your life yeah me too for someone who prefers written communication above all else i find writing this letter to be one of the most difficult tasks literally me if i didn t have work i would have gone to the march every conversation with my infj friend me you think that way too infj yes how are we so similar ni cely predicted vampire diaries greys anatomy teen wolf random indie films etc unapologetic spam of my black and white aesthetic of movie and tv quotes i found our gif person i have news me tell me all the things sends million messages person it easier to dwell on all the people who didn t try but it better to invest in the good friendships you have now honestly find people who will put effort into the relationship and be willing to stop trying for friendships that aren t reciprocal don t trust the people who don t respond to any texts or ask how you are doing but in person act like you haven t talked in forever beware of the people who will talk to you over social media but won t acknowledge you in person they just want attention not friendship be careful of the acquaintances who unload their and their friends drama on you information about your life will be spread just as easily all of these are me is there such a thing as an accidental genius i literally just want to write short stories about reincarnation now i effing love this me moral of the story of these tweets don t give into perfectionism have friends who remind you you re better than your flaws being a perfectionist means feeling like a fake and that sense of dread as you wait for people to figure that out being a perfectionist means accepting love feels like a chore because you feel the one who loves you don t see all your flaws being a perfectionist means scoring perfectly on a test walking out of the room and feeling like it was a fluke being a perfectionist means a constant state of lowkey anxiety as you try to enjoy the moment while you know what else you could be doing being a perfectionist means trying and if you do well it isn t enough and if you mess it up you re devastated by the smallest mistake one person can make you sad for eternity it up to you to try and move on to better things they would have tried if they wanted to skip the sad song that reminds you of them take a walk instead of refreshing social media for their status update take care of yourself ever get a bad vibe after meeting someone yeah me too they ve all had wicked senses of humor held interesting conversations and i ve usually helped out when they forgot or didn t plan i ll observe and try to confirm my typing as the semester goes on if he is i have a pattern and it makes me laugh enxps are great being forgetful applies to every type but the enfp and entp i became friends with last semester acted very similarly to this guy he was five minutes late to class forgot his pencil asked for a sip of my water because he needed some to take his pills tentatively typing one of my classmates as an enfp my theory is i find an enxp every semester or they find me yep it was a bubble but a pleasant hours nevertheless i feel like a mom figure to of the people in my life esfp oh that my résumé tosses it in the trash
infj,when you know what people are going to ask before they ask what are some of your favorite different topics to talk about mine are the night the water eyes and my infj journey of course sometimes i wonder if my love is meant to cast a wide net instead of a single line it doesn t seem designed for depth with one person the feelings of the past never fully fade anniversaries and memories are hard when things aren t what they once were thinking about what used to be and what no longer is and what can never be don t think i ve ever taken it anyone ever feel like they don t belong anywhere or with anyone when you reach out to someone to help make a huge life decision and you re painfully reminded you can t count on anyone thank you love is an action even if we don t receive it as much as we would like we need to give it all the more being mentored in one conversation and mentoring someone in another conversation that how it should be i don t know hopefully but doubtful when you embarrass yourself in front of your crush something i ve learned my feelings about people are not dependent on their feelings for me i can like someone even if they don t like me of the hardest things is seeing the potential u have w someone but life prevents u from making a connection w them amp you re left to wonder is it too much to ask someone to think of me be there for me to see me as a person we want god to provide more so that we need to rely on him less how sad is that something i said led someone else to do an act of kindness for a random stranger the change of seasons can be a powerful thing so many people are on my mind at the end of the day i wonder if any of them think of me when our voices our drowned out by the shouts of those we call friends people tend to want to talk at you more than they want to talk with you i m searching for a world that does not yet exist these are the times when you really figure out who cares no matter who or what it is it obsession or apathy there no in between maybe night becomes so lonely because the stars are so far away when we ve been strong and alone for so long that we can t remember what it like for someone to truly be there for us faint stars faint dreams past few days i ve been humbly reminded on how different i think den the majority of people the heart remembers things long forgotten by the head anyone else feel more alive when the earth awakens and hints of spring arrive in the air most encouraging conversation i ve had in a long time from bible study tonight maybe desiring to follow god is following god they always think of the haves and not those who lack my emotions are so powerful and often distort gods truth i m only one person but i can take on the emotions of everyone around me we thirst for the future and past in our minds and hearts on a brighter note church was great today almost didn t go but as soon as i got there i encounter the loving god another person i know hair got engaged happy for them but would like to be happy for me one day too you know i ve come to believe that shame is the worst of all the emotions the holidays so many emotions i have a different journal for every part of my life and still want more journals in vivid memories in the middle of the night that where i find you that where i find me my wish is that everyone could know the impact their words truly have on those who hear them both good and bad how different would we be stargazing moves me in a way that hard to describe things affect me so much the emotion reaches down to my core love this time of year but trying to find and recapture the magic that just not quite the same as when i was a kid i watched the stars from my window sill the whole world is movie but i m standing still one of those nights tomorrow is a new day and new opportunity to make a difference in the world how many chances am i going to give people stuck between forgiveness and trust so many thoughts in my head at times like these so often i wonder what wrong with me i have desires for so many things i have never known or even properly imagined i think i have more to say to people i see every day than those i haven t seen or talked to in months i have no idea where my life is going but you can be sure i ll over analyze it for days i have all these great date ideas and never get to use them pain is so very real that awful hope there were some bright spots to your day this is a good way to start monday i make decisions constantly which positively affect the people in my life and they ll never know about it because that how i am are we all trying to figure out how to live and missing out on actually living why i am always the one who models for others proper human interactions just once i would like to catch a break when will people learn the relationship has to take priority over the task rule situation i wasn t expecting that hope your day got better today i always get lonely at the end of the night i share in the happiness of others but i want my own happiness too that is how i can be both happy and sad at the same time life experiences at the same time what happens to the friendship can it be as close it has to change as the experience has changed the friends we are closest with are those who we go through life together with sharing experiences but when we are no longer going through
infj,thank you so much i really really appreciate that i m struggling with balance time for myself feels almost nonexistent as of late constantly frazzled and overwhelmed i m lonely but i don t feel particularly like talking to anybody we were talking like we were being real but something was missing another dynamic change i suppose why do i feel like i need to apologize this is the most sad i ve been in a while it hurts do i need to take on less or utilize better coping mechanisms i can t speak my mental exhaustion is taking over me but i miss you and i care about you and i m sorry i m being terrible at showing it when i get to this point thinking about the overwhelming stress does nothing but hurt me i really think the only solution is sleep everything just hit me a longer buildup than usual all the people worries small conversations big frustrations the little things that i could let bother me fade away as i remember we love each other we care for each other we re here for each other i wish i could do more it pains me to see you suffering the way i did not so long ago i m full of questions and i know they will only fully be answered once i act but my nerves always try to find a way to get the best of me my heart has already made my decision but how can i pursue this dream if i don t know where to begin how do i overcome my inhibitions do i dare take the risk for the possibility of a reward that has never been so close i usually don t post specific personal things on here but i got into my top school and i am elated i can t express my exhaustion pretending like it ok when each time my soul crushes a little more i m so so so tired of rejection in every form when will love find me when will i stop missing what feelings are real and what just stem from my adoration of your affection towards me don t continue w the defense that neither candidate is good especially now wake up my heart hurts i m scared for what the future holds and yes i do see your mind trying to change the story to benefit you and your ego let not play games and instead lets own up to what we both did and felt hard yes worth it absolutely want to talk honestly we both equally played a part that what a relationship is or should be flattery isnt a part of this honesty is why did you act like it meant nothing to you like you didn t even play a part don t boost your ego thinking i m desperate just because i if i m having trouble placing feelings of intense frustration it time to spend some serious time alone oh how nice that feels i think the best thing to do is just sit with myself for a little bit away from it all but there is a point when it not healthy and you know it time to let go and give yourself some space here i am back to being frustrated by you then feeling guilty and then feeling unsure where to go round goes the cycle i m sorry don t say sorry so much sorry hyper focusing again i ve come to accept rationally that relationships change in ways that aren t always easy emotionally i m not sure i ve gotten there don t think for a second that i won t carry on without you as a fantasy i wouldn t want you so deeply misled i ll repeat it until it becomes true i know what i m worth certain situations other people perceptions responses i won t let these alter the love i feel for myself having an irrational expectation that the person i m talking to will say what i want to hear and help me reach a conclusion the way i need processing happens best for me when i m alone while talking can help it can also end up making me feel more frustrated because i end up realizing a lot of my frustration stems from my inability to act how i want to without feeling a sense of guilt and need to justify i think they more felt the need to conform to the social hierarchy in a group setting when youre gone i see you in every picture i hear you in every song romanticizing something that never felt quite so pure when you were here busy life i live actions become mindless and i quickly forget the importance of my mental health to remember to make time for myself inside me wants to push away the thought and continue being fine how i feel i m expected to be it can be so hard to separate from the often times it can take some deep analysis to even fully acknowledge that i m having a rough time although it may seem obvious something there no better time to start loving and embracing dwelling on the negatives is easy but ultimately very hurtful time to focus on what truly matters my brain will not stop working on a problem that doesn t need to be fixed they are probably thinking about it a lot less than you are learning it not impolite to stand up for amp assert myself in situations that make me uncomfortable big or small i can have needs too it been a long week ready to do some refueling and letting go the web of relationships we weave is so delicate transition periods never have been easy for me heavy sigh practicing the art of letting relationships play out and feeling like i don t need to be in constant control you left but this time i m not going running i ll practice my patience to see when you ll come back lately feeling in some ways like my life doesn t feel like my own feeling extremely sensitive to others needs yet so quickly disregarding my own it time i give myself a break slightly changing how you act around me when you re around different people is expected a drastic change that what hurts feeling a deep appreciation for myself and the road on which i ve traveled to arrive where i am today pain and hurt yes but pride and love i think i ll take some time to appreciate the fact that i m feeling very at peace not sure how but i m sure not questioning not everybody will love you not everybody will see your beauty that doesn t make it any less yours there always been a weird tension not sure how to label it so i won t but i d be lying if i said it didn t give me an itch once in a while smiling from the heart if you consistently find yourself pointing fingers when conflict arises don t you think it time to step back and evaluate constantly reminding myself that their problems my problems i can care and listen but there are boundaries for my emotional attachment when you are so close with someone it can be hard to lay out boundaries both for the relationship and for yourself i don t mean in terms of growing apart i mean in terms of maintaining friendships and recognizing and defining boundaries it important to feel close to people you ve formed close bonds with what i struggle with sometimes is separating myself from these people the intention often good but viewing anything straying from your definition of normality as an issue is a less than constructive attitude allow people to have situations in their lives without feeling like you need to change or resolve them there not always a problem that needs to be fixed it really turned around that i m apologizing for expressing how i feel why do i keep doing that so i can save you from the real me i asked if you needed space took me long enough to realize it me who needs it beginning to feel more like a burden rather than a person of value whether it all in my head or not is debatable discussion of feelings has been lacking and i feel guilty and bothersome continually initiating it based on responses less than perfect and stressed or upset at times i ve felt like my needs haven t been met in a way they had before an honest it was more along the lines of a connection where both people are aware of the others needs however lately when i ve felt and the most painful thing is i thought we understood each other and now i m seeing otherwise how do you deal with this pain i struggle to emote strong feelings to friends beyond a certain circle finding the limitations and frustrations this brings each day does something slightly risky worries about it for a weeks to months after i ve seen the outcome sometimes it so important to just laugh at yourself as hard as it can be we can be ridiculous amp it good to acknowledge that
infj,touche but painting almost done bc deadlines grumbles then pouts but hw sick kayla should not tweet if you need me i ll be in my hobbit hole honestly i was reflecting about how people find comfort in perhaps the films amp shows they digest interesting concept so now that you ve seen both can you guess which one is true i like watching happy feel good movies i feel comforted when i watch them i like watching dysfunctional conflict in movies i feel comforted when i watch them ba da ba ba bah one of the many reasons if it a week then it too long lol you just made my day gorgeous spends four hours trying to find the perfect gif twitter has now become facebook i ll go get the defibrillator how what even no antivirus okay but seriously can we just take off the numlock on keyboards its purpose seemingly is to troll everyone who use the number pad strokes imaginary beard both erm isn t in n out jack in the box and such open until am explain the fact that my dad uses the saying dogs behave better then my children to joke with other adults to fit in feels pretty degrading hang on i m doing hw and let me nurture this thought before i tweet out a response selectively platonic i ll make the exception to others as replies i wanted to screen and decipher thoughts feedback is welcome do you seem to have a lot of platonic friendships relationships lt ty fever broke at least for now lovely i have a fever in addition to the sore throat now i have work tomorrow at am and i have to speak help students dad has now moved him is currently chilling on our fireplace next to the fire without moving my dad brought in a lizard from outside our house native and was like it so cold poor thing he jumped out of his hands and when you re sick again and you have so much sh t to do you just want to cry and just the bigger the group the less you ll probably get to know me ditto what a complicated world we live in pets bring so much joy into your life lt when was the last time you approached something with an objective point of view she also hates painting i mean gouache is stupid i don t blame her my asl needs work i have performance anxiety lol deaf kid is rather distant w everyone not meshing well w interpreters i stepped in to maybe become friends but we exchanged numbers nods you know me so well the gif speaks to my soul yes tysm if i didn t have like sensors around lord knows i would be so lost so thanks rt rt rt rt i need a break from myself i completely understand i m still not exactly fitting in the woman in other words being a stick with a sudden baby birthing waist means nothing in fashion d again with the nightmares refilling my humidifier every night is annoying af i think it more of an introvert thing you can try it now shoot a question and i ll get back to you momentarily speaking from personal experience i turn off my f and it looks feels like i am a t it a scary persona in toxic environments the infj fe will deteriorate while the ti will move up and substitute my dad just now noticed that the media is biased i now have a love hate relationship with emails i apologize in advance if i confuse anyone while on the phone for anything important i suck at those things also who likes phone calls completely understand the professor has a therapy like atmosphere so it helps apparently the discipline of contour lines or at least that what implied how tf am i going to draw a tree for two hours using one line

infj,to be honest sometimes i get tired of myself not in a depressing way necessarily but more like wow girl really kind of way yakno bookstores are the best i need to stop being afraid of being happy we as humans ultimately need to pick a side humanity or eminent destruction i wish it was that simple every so often you meet a random stranger that leave the most lovely imprint amp you never see them again but you re changed for the better does anyone here carry crystals on them and if so what kind am i right lol thanks such a bummer need to start listening to that little voice more bleh didn t listen to my intuition this morning when it told me to transfer my wallet somewhere else gt gt gt wallet got stolen i feel like no man will ever be able to handle my infjness frustrating when they re so tired of you always being right that they would rather lie than for you to be right again can anyone else feel the suffering of humanity of the world i have always loved snow becauseit the only peaceful thing that can stop the world in its tracks and just be still i have a confession sometimes the evil moments are wildly satisfying what are people opinion thoughts on the mandela effect now i m all worried about dying in a solar storm damn being on the treadmill at the gym is forcing me to watch fox news now i m all stressed out i never watch the news and this is why reasons why infjs could rule the world of my favoritearticles i ve ever read it just different that gut wrenching feeling when someone cancels plans with you last min and you repeat to yourself it fine its ok like its your mantra true i just find myself having moments of resentment towards being an infj but i feel its bc of some people in my life after talking to others on here i feel like i have much to learn still and some growing to do i get frustrated with myself do you ever sometimes find yourself wishing you weren t an introvert wow yes that makes sense i never put the two together i feel so tired all of the time no matter how much caffeine i have i actually love the museum idea thank you this when something makes so much sense you can barely formulate words just ughhhhhhhhh you re right which now i realize is also not being in solitude but one problem at a time i guess hm food for thought thank you perhaps i should start turning to friends more to distract me from wanting companionship ok now i don t feel as crazy i love your game plan so brilliant so infj i just keep getting mindlessly drawn to people its hard for me to be alone for a long time will this need for companionship go away w age or practice or am i just odd how do other infjs get themselves out of a funk rm drake is amazing things get really ugly when we use our powers for evil its hard knowing you can t ever fall apart because the thought of the pain it would bring to your loved ones trumps your pain you re right i just feel like i never cease to be amazed at what we can do its so very humbling and heartbreaking at times okay i ve always wondered if i was imagining things but i also always prayed that i was help do any of you infjs find it difficult to stay single agree it refreshing to not have to choose my words so carefully they usually just get it this th extinction thing i knew it i knew i felt funny my whole life something just felt off anyone else my heart cant survive openly and completely as is in this world so in turn i fashion my world and the people in it around my heart i miss the excitement of summer vacation as a child jesus this mercury retrograde really sucks i wish i had more patience i think the whole skipping steps thing has really messed with my patience levels you know in many aspects an infj would make the most kick ass lawyer i must remember to watch the fine line between overbearing and good intentions even tho i think it best it ends up pushing people away never let your infj significant other feel like they re alone in the relationship nothing will break her quite like that feeling i feel weird today is this supermoon effecting anyone else just me that super moon though i just want someone to take care of me for once it just feels so difficult sometimes being with someone plus dealing with this brain of mine w all of its nonstop tinkering when i was a kid too boom yes i just realized you re from seattle too d i agree idk what more difficult that or being with someone extremely opposite of an infj oh hush you from your tweets alone you seem like an amazing person my fear is actually that i will grow tired of them anyone else here weary of marriage just worried about finding someone who is willing be patient w all of your quirks and vice versa i m horrible at re telling a story i stumble over my words and have to back track bc i have a difficult time remembering how it really went same here my thumb never scrolled so fast in fear of seeing a picture of it i can t ever watch videos like that when i try i can actually feel the different seasons each season has it own feel to it neat the lonely phases can be so difficult had an emotional breakdown in front of my friends yesterday and now i m so embarrassed of myself as i replay the night in my head it hilarious how i m always excited for an event outing until the day of and theni m like shit i gotta be around all those people thanks for the follow and can i just say that the florida keys is my absolute favorite place in the world a little immature of me but hey it spoke to me lol

infj,empty
infj,this there are some opinions i refuse to share even when they weigh of my mind heavily i need someone who doesn t leave me in my own head for too long what was really in the gift melania gave michelle i wish i knew who i was people can be so easily tricked i just want to avoid that kind of proposition i know it has become irrational to not even want to become friends with anybody into those relationships somewhere along the way i became so paranoid that it would happen again i love this app eating is just as important as sleep is you should eat perhaps then i m afraid i disagree this is a fallen world and everything is flawed i feel like i can make a good estimate of what is perceived as perfect and i would like to be that how can you know for certain it really does take one bad egg to spoil the bunch makes the best objective decision for everybody i don t know what you re doing but with my limited sight i don t like it i the episode was disturbing and i do not like tree trunks crushed for your holy soul concealed and cold i just want to be perfect why is that so hard this will be known as the great guacamole panic of not the guacamole the story is so compelling that i just cannot look away the intricacies and multiple facets of each character is fascinating i hate to admit that i somewhat enjoy watching this story unfold in front of me and seeing my predictions come to life i ve just stepped away from it for a while to let any of the recent events kind of fade from my timeline i try to resist the urge to give any opinions or even facts on facebook anymore i only exist because you allow me to exist me what a happy time this has been nothing could possibly ruin it life how could i not i did not pardon your fun of course you were missed where have you been seeing a guy who is both sensitive and protective coupled with the fact that he good with kids is honestly too much for me to handle this honestly sounds like something i would do too my friends and i are joksters like this in case you re wondering what kind of conversations i have my love for you will live forever you however will not i m probably reading too much into it i m definitely the type to overthink everything i do and how i come across to others and someone who provides security safety and offers intelligent conversation as well a peaceful amp neat environment preferably somewhere with moody lighting where you can curl up with a good book why do we actively allow the existence of non effective world leaders scientist i like the cat emoticons i think for me personally smiling that much was always a sign of holding back anger and trying to be composed oh my is it just me or does the emoticon seem super passive aggressive i always preferred the instead because it looked more genuine melania giving michelle her speech back this entire thread is so accurate for me as well i did what i had to do to survive i feel so cold so very cold i m not a political statement i m a human being escaping from the problems that led me into this is a good temporary solution but not a good permanent one falling down the rabbit hole of deeper and deeper and deeper i hoped that you would burn but i guess i will have to freeze you out instead pull out your heart to make being alone easier

infj,exactly it strips us of our humanity when we look away inaction scares me a heck of a lot more than protest one more no joy only increases the more it shared also it feels good to know i m slightly more prepared to defend myself in the upcoming armageddon also i think there something to be said for tough workouts releasing a ton of pent up anger and or anxiety ooh i d say they re the same but w a different release of emotions dancing joy exercising anger anxiety it so cathartic to be able to yell and swear and sweat without worrying about what anyone else thinks of you working out alone in my living room is my new favourite thing i ask because i ve been known to misjudge the platonicity of my friendships on occasion platonic on whose side yeah i m hollowing out my usage of it too mostly just use it to follow news outlets journalists and a few artists i think we re seeing democracy at its finest it more than just voting once every few years there is something unnatural about getting into a fb debate with someone i went to high school with like we should ve lost touch years ago this also happens to me all the time in public even brief interactions are so psychologically complex in ways we ll never know awwwww when i hear people say they think everything is going to be fine it strengthens my resolve to fight because it isn t and someone has to being ignorant doesn t keep you safe entp it just a loop don t say that out loud wait did i say that out loud me how many times a day do you say to yourself don t say that out loud entp oh my god constantly it the default anytime feel free to dm you can support insert cause here without having the t shirt that is exactly how i felt in my st and nd year of undergrad keep going you can do this and it does get better cc having voicing opinions does not make you any less nice anyone who equates niceness with silence is a coward stop giving other people control over your ability to make positive life choices for yourself stop waiting for their permission to grow i mean it worth a shot right i can usually talk myself down to having an extra slice of cake with no regrets seriously i m normally more of a letter writer than a marching protester but when push comes to shove soooooooooo many feels today god this makes me so happy laughter is an act of resistance i get that some people have to learn things the hard way but i just don t think it fair to take the rest of the world with them in my experience istjs have some trouble seeing themselves clearly so self tests can be problematic when you re off the beaten path progress is more meaningful but harder won i really like having more autonomy but that means letting go of my old safety nets living and dying by my own sword metaphorically i spent most of my being pretty opportunistic but within a predetermined framework then i threw the whole framework out the window trying to find a balance between actively creating the life i want for myself and loosening my perfectionist tendencies i hold pain physically too maybe try writing things down express yourself in a passive way so that you re not expecting a response this happens to me almost every night too slowly drifting off into a peaceful sleep when my entp gently inquires do you have cankles idealist mom infp and rational dad intj i think i ve always felt loved too but not sure how much i ve ever been heard talking w my parents often feels less like a dialogue and more like them running through a list of things they ve been meaning to tell me it freakishly adorable right my face when non infjs try to understand the doorslam reminds me of this i don t understand your question funny though bc this tweet stemmed from a convo w my infp mom she the same way as you habit is the antithesis of thoughtfulness i strive to make as few things a habit in my life as possible this was the jist of a minute back and forth from a family get together last night intp just imagine this hypothetical situation istj i can t because it doesn t currently exist intp no imagine istj i can t for better or for worse we are each the product of our unique past experiences from prisoner of tehran by marina nemat love had its way of doing things it was like spring crawling into the skin of the earth at the end of winter but i suppose it something that i now have this expanded vocabulary to express what i know about myself even if no one yet listens i would not say i m grateful for having had my identity broken apart and having had to expend so much energy putting it back together recovering from that relationship felt child like discovering my identity once again through exploration and small cautious risks being with a gaslighter first makes you wonder who am i and later do i even exist is any of this real you want to etch these words into your skin to make sure there is some record of this core human identity that you ve been stripped down to i am good i am worthy i am doing my best i will keep going when you finally reach your limit you ll feel empty hollowed out just an endless loop of self affirmations playing in your mind the thing you agreed on yesterday is suddenly a problem today there is never understanding or consistency to a gaslighter you ll never be good enough you ll never be accepted you ll always struggle for stability be surrounded by uncertainty over time this robotic way of thinking destroys your self confidence and any sense of spontaneity but it the only way to survive you had have to be very clear minded and consistent about these things or you would lose all sense of reality the thing about having loved a gaslighter is that you become very good at articulating your thoughts and feelings even if no one hears you although that is for intp infj relationships it applies to us note we met in our late maturity definitely factored in yeah my husband is an entp it works wonderfully for us and also other couples i know a lot like this i have yet to find this limit with my entp which to me is one of his very best qualities ime debates with a te dom aux always end with them abruptly getting offended once you reach the limit of their pre determined thoughts thank you it was a whirlwind but we managed to capture some amazing moments together like this totally has its moments but i d way rather this way than the opposite where you have the details but no real big picture

infj,i always border on being too emotional and too analytical an interesting mix his you love yourself is how you teach others to love you rupi kaur milk amp honey yes and no i would like a chance to fix things and bring some balance but i don t like how much power comes with it never doubt your intuition even when it comes to the smallest things no one is you and that is your power dave grohl type wheel i love when the people around me are happy secondhand happiness is the most magical feeling finally was able to forgive and let go of some pain that had been lingering for far too long it feels good it allows me to solve problems to find beauty in unexpected places it allows me to forgive and to laugh when all else fails i m thankful i can t imagine not feeling every single little thing deep to my core i see it as more of a blessing than a curse so many feelings floating around not enough time to analyze them all looking beautiful is not the most important thing in the world but feeling beautiful is sometimes i have kept my feelings to myself because i could find no language to describe them in jane austen sense and sensibility it like you pass them and you can tap into their whole aura and you feel them and then they re gone and that all you know of them isn t it so strange to pass people in the street and know that all you ll most likely ever know of them protect your sensitivity but don t ever let the world make you a cold person empathy is truly a magical thing don t ever let anyone make you feel like you re overreacting or overthinking things how scary it is to feel blank or empty minded i m forever thankful for the endless thoughts that always seem to be running through my mind source i always try to remind myself that just because i disagree with someone it doesn t make them wrong but sometimes they are morally wrong any other infjs hate debating cause then you feel bad that the people with the conflicting views has such awful views in the first place no great mind has ever existed without a touch of madness aristotle sorry for the lack of tweets i ve been a bit busy lately i don t so much dwell in negative emotion like i used to and i feel i m healthy i used to thrive in negativity but now i avoid it that what i was thinking but at my unhealthiest i was so obviously type four but now i feel i m a lot like a nine it makes sense and it fits me very well but i also feel like when i was unhealthy i was so obviously a type four so i don t know i ve always felt i am a healthy type four but i just tested as a type two and now i don t know what to think it is a fire that consumes me but i am the fire jorge luis borges a new refutation of time i m no expert though just passionate if you re an infj and you re not really a feeler that doesn t really make sense i usually suggest either an assertive infj or an intj anyone else ever have issues like this and has anyone ever come across an infj who isn t comfortable with feelings of any kind i m not trying to shame or offend anyone by suggesting that they may be a different type but they usually express conflicted feelings there really no special personality type each type is as meaningful and diverse as the next i can spot a person type so easily it bothers me so bad when people say they re and infj but they re not cause there no closure there so many contradictions everywhere i don t fit but i mingle well but it never the satisfying type of interaction i m only half heard i always say it the four in me since i seem to so easily converse with people but i never feel truly accepted i understand people and relationships so well yet i will never fit in at a party or i ll never have a group of friends and etc i usually never dwell on this too much and i ve gotten over it a long time ago but it still creeps up on me sometimes it frustrates me to no end how i m in the middle of everyone all the time i understand everyone and everything yet i m so outcasted balanced most times not always though and that okay blame that on ni while i so easily understand literally everything i have a hard time explaining why that is or say breaking it down for another person i always feel like i can explain my thoughts and feelings so clearly but actually getting them from my brain and into the world is hard to be mindful is to find hidden beauty in unexpected places i keep my mind focused outwards to get a feel for the things around me then i turn inwards to dissect and analyze what i find and feel those moments are far and few nowadays helping and interacting with others keeps my mind focused outwards but i keep a balance now and that always leads me back to my own mind and my own safe little world the counselor in me tells me i m being self absorbed those times generally i stay pretty sanguine and serene but when i hit a low point i find myself getting rather annoyed and bored by everything i can find talking to be boring cause i know what point someone is trying to make and people always think one thing and say another i m so fully and overly aware of everything that can find reality to be boring i m trying not to think that way so much but at the same time i m fully aware of the differences between my own brain and the outside world what might take me five seconds to say i have contemplated and nit picked about times over in my head i analyze literally everything i forget that things i imagine so vividly haven t really happened or i forget people aren t aware of how much thought i put into things sometimes i forget not everyone is aware of my own inner word since i get lost in it so easily i m never bored or lonely in a way it makes me feel like i have a super power but i also don t want people to feel like i have the upper hand i want us to be equal i tend to know and notice a lot very easily and i notice it can make people quite uncomfortable but that just so naturally me i love to analyze everything and i m not always sure if that good or not it can make me feel quite intrusive please consider me a dream franz kafka it hard to explain in words but i feel like i can now control the flow of emotions that seem to drift to me like my mind is finely tuned i feel like the best version of myself i m active in helping those who come to me and they give me such amazing feedback it feels amazing i m a turbulent infj so this hasn t always been the norm for me but it refreshing i feel i ve really come to understand a lot i feel rather balanced and serene in myself most days even when i have flurries of thoughts in my head i feel balanced for everything you have missed you have gained something else ralph waldo emerson sorry for the break in tweets now that the holidays are over i m finally back to my normal state of perpetual free time the dreamers are the saviors of the world james allen been a bit busy with the holidays lately so forgive me if i m a bit spotty with posting but sometimes your light attracts moths and your warmth attracts parasites protect your space and energy warsan shire contradictions everywhere which i hate about myself because i can get rather annoyed if someone tries to explain something to me when i already understand i always find myself tweeting a question and then answering it before anyone can answer usually to share in my disbelief blessed are they who see beautiful things in humble places where other people see nothing camille pissarro the soul becomes dyed with the color of its thoughts marcus aurelius empathy is off the charts right now i can t watch or read anything without ending up crying or taking on all the emotions as my own

infj,the most important thing i learnt from being a touring musician it the person mind not the country of origin alec empire volt soundtrack is coming out on vinyl next week watch his interview gekommen vielleicht nicht aber geblieben die grenze wenn eine gesellschaft zur barbarei verfällt und wie rettet man leben very sad how silent germany left is on this issue a reality i see every day in kreuzberg and neukölln berlin haven t seen the film yet but the trailer looks amazing can t wait watch alec empire intro music for the rare avant garde film phantomanie from first they invented their own gods anyway your first tweet is something i really agree with hopefully some of my followers read it why that strange i just replied to the angry guy now i have dragged an innocent bystander into this i apologize sorry the angry pro violence added you to make himself appear bigger it felt like two against one at times highly recommended read interview with oliver gillet from mutable instruments nic endo quote of the day what are you doing this weekend which atr songs do you have in your playlist pre order alec empire new album on itunes and that is from the leftist anti semitic handbook especially when you bring up israel one tweet after what you did was you made your tweet sound like i somehow took richard spencer side which is a lie spare us of the my closest friends are anti zionist jews rethoric listen to new alec empire track from his upcoming film score album so this is what you spreading a lie about me was about after all interesting old fashioned jew hatred du rufst öffentlich zur gewalt auf verstehst keinen kontext beim darauf hinweisen reagierst du wie ein schüler it also takes a peanut brain to laugh about heroes like gene sharp that what you just did if you didn t understand what amp me spoke about you shouldn t be an activist and rethink your violent strategy deine tweets zum thema aktivismus amp gewalt sind gefährlich dumm you don t even know what i said but you repeat something false you are part of the problem why the left is losing alec empire speaks about his new album soundtrack for film out on feb rd people hate me too now for having a different opinion on violent protests against the state nobody convinced me so far that is probably why i am not part of what you call your movement if logic truth and reason are abandoned from it wenn deine gewaltstrategien so super aufgehen seit jahrzehnten warum wächst denn das problem hast du gelesen worüber wir gesprochen haben es ging um gewaltfreien aktivismus yes it changed my life my approach to life and it made it better use your mind and reason du meinst wirklich ernsthaft daß deine faust eine besseres tool ist als dein gehirn dein instinkt steht über dem verstand lies meine tweets wenn es nicht klick macht noch klarer sag ich es nicht ich hab wenigstens versucht mit euch na dann viel glück beim stoppen des rechtsruck durch gewalt ich bin nicht dabei hab das hier genau erklärt mal nicht das thema wechseln wir haben über gewaltfreien aktivismus gesprochen doch wenn die linke nicht überzeugen kann was sie anscheinend nicht kann man wird nicht rechtsradikal geboren thank you inspiring text as always ich solidarisiere mich mit niemanden ich bin für mich selbst verantwortlich und mit gewaltstrategen solidarisiere ich mich nicht dann benutze halt gewalt um den rechtsruck in europa zu bekämpfen ich lehne das ab weil es erfolglos sein wird es ist besser mit dem kopf und ideen faschistische ideologien in einer demokratie zu bekämpfen das sage ich ihr meintet ich wäre ein arschloch weil ich das hier mit pete fein getweetet habe dann schau halt nicht mehr zu und beteilige dich ich sage das weil du ja anscheinend gewalt als angemessen findest in dieser phase des politischen aktivismus weil das versagen der linken diesen rechtsruck zu veranworten hat von europa bis zu den usa das haben wir ja schon längst klargestellt aber wir sind nicht im dritten reich warum ist das wohl so selbstkritik würde der linken besser tun als gewalt anzuwenden i can only advise every actvist out there to rethink that strategy it failing use your mind they have the guns und du meinst daß gewalt das ändert und nicht die besseren argumente es muss also den massen eingeprügelt werden we didn t speak about richard spencer we spoke about activism in general spencer won t get very far with his views der aufstieg des faschismus die usa sind noch eine demokratie ein republikanischer präsident kann das nicht ändern da liegt das problem um solche richtig zu erfahren muss man frau sie richtig schauen if you want violent protests it your decision i am not part of that i just gave advice here der kern ist sehr klein zu klein leider hat hillary clinton das geändert indem sie damit trump bekämpfen wollte du hast zu lange vor computern gesessen schau ihn nochmal in d und dann neon demon that is wrong on all levels and dangerous to tweet this is an image from world war ii has nothing to do with protests in a democracy dass du nicht lost river verstehst überrascht mich etwas im dritten reich war dies der fall wir sind aber weit davon entfernt da liegt der unterschied ich habe vorhin getweetet wenn eine gesellschaft in barbarei übergeht muss man leider gewalt anwenden um leben zu retten the point is once you move to violence against a dictatorship state you will lose always it not because i can t repeat the book on twitter it the essential manual for every activist damit stimme ich nicht überein diese kleine gruppe kann vielleicht nicht überzeugt werden die breitere masse schon und da meinst du ernsthaft daß gewalt die gesellschaft vor dem faschismus beschützt wahnsinn wir leben aber nicht im faschismus und das ist entscheidend in der diskussion the important tweet was about gene sharp book from dictatorship to democracy interesting that you missed this because that where the state wins to battle ideas is far more difficult but read gene sharp

infj,i ll delete it because i don t want favoritism here thank goodness i didn t choose any of the other options because now that really would have been embarrassing now i m embarassed wtf i didn t know i made an automated tweet till now lol i made a tweet one time about me only taking what i explicitly imply i now take that tweet back because it only in certain situations nice thank you so much for taking time out of your life you re welcome how can i get more involved in the world i feel de perhaps try to join gatherings and meetups i m goi i know you guys are very thoughtful and put your th no it is not a big deal for me as i enjoy showing i did an enneagram test once and i think i got w anyway i want to explore myself further i m planning to take more professional tests which will discover me more and i can improve myself this depends on the significance of the event or tournament however for example i just want to win and focus on the results of winning i m ill prepared for losing when i lose it utterly destroys me i think i ve now confirmed that i m an infj i use ne but i just don t really like to focus on the different possibilities hmm that looks interesting i ll save it for future reference for following those there are times where i can be turbulent and other times where i can be assertive however it so easy to degrade calling myself the worst names but i try hard to not do that it also puts me deeper in the hole i ve been feeling loneliness and depression for pretty much my whole life somewhat i mean i have difficulties in the choices i make i can make choices but i don t feel excitement in some cases what do you mean by loop of darkness i did personalities again infj t one tendancy i have is i m generally a lazy person but once i m actually bothered for example with organising i will organise it heavily this is what i mean they are both important lmao what i find funny is that on these tests i can exactly tell what these questions will influence for each trait that good self love is a very important asset i m still trying to find it myself i m going to do some mbti tests now this was my result on personalities on which mbti type i am a while ago i wonder if best friends actually exist i get envious of people who have been great friends for many years i feel like i always screw up welp i m in my period of loneliness at the moment just happens randomly but you know what i may try lol soon seems interesting way too many to list haha i have everything aside from xbox one this is what i follow very strictly what games would you recommend don t really play video games much lately but i used to play final fantasy xiv a lot pretty bored just relaxing haha how is everyone doing today now i m so bored i actually ranted from the heart for once i m learning how to sweettalk trolls hahahaha questions confessions or just simply want to vent what is tough however is that i feel that i have to show it in order to get the attention from somebody my pain and suffering is not easily visible i shouldn t have to act sick to let you know my outside doesn t represent my inside every single one of you who reads my tweets and especially ones that do interact with me deep down in my heart i truly love amp appreciate it the challenge with twitter is i need to fit everything in characters for your viewing convenience and i try hard to do that i like being completely honest in regards to the way i feel in my personal life i try my best into putting my thoughts into words and i m saying my thoughts amp feelings all of you guys who interact with me whether it here on twitter or curiouscat means a lot to me it really nice knowing that i have many people following this account it like you all are in front of me as an audience and i m noticing in myself that i m starting to be more expressive and open on this account i m bored do you play overwatch if so what platform i play i do not it does look very interesting though fro do your parents have different mbti types than you i ve been trying to analyse the mbti types in my fa that being said i feel like a hypocrite giving advice because i struggle with applying it to myself i generally do not like generalising other infjs like say infjs do xyz because everyone is different and i may even get some things wrong are you a night owl or an early bird both really i wish i could be awake all the time victoria islamic center rebuildingi donated yup to be honest i m thinking of changing my name and handle on here labels can get really unhealthy for me what i m afraid of is saying something constructive regardless of length and then everyone jumps on me in regards to the point i made snarky comments aimed towards me boil my blood i wish i could you know just chill with you for a while in the open yes but not anyone close to us i don t even just mean it in a romantic sense either i wonder what love truly feels like do you know how to swim probably not never have swimmed since about yea do you know who wrote this question yeah you did you why are infjs so sensitive and emotional i think it how we want to maintain harmony due to what new hobby are you looking forward tl learning learning how to self teach myself haha i also wan i m only human though i try to answer as much as i can but please don t feel down if i don t respond to you it doesn t mean i dislike you if anyone usefully interacts with me on this account i ll try to not ignore you i hate it when anyone feel left out i really dislike favoritism say if i m leading a group i want everyone receiving benefits based on the amount of work they put in i m actually having dreams these last few days i m actually looking forward to this meetup because i love instant replies amp i know what other person is doing haha text doesn t have that is there anything that would ever make you change y if there was extreme amounts of evidence which logi why do you think you may be an infp i just feel like there are some traits which i rela for shy and anxious people i m actually going to a meetup on tuesday wow are you good with computers and coding i have amazing it skills i used to be obsessed wit what does planet infj look like only things that are necessary for survival and tow

infj,pay attention when people react with anger amp hostility to your boundaries you have found the edge where their respect for you ends i m often cold as ice but in the right hands i ll melt quiet people have the loudest minds i ve heard one of our own is our ideal match it could work out very well with time guys can be a little slow no matter type that def makes sense then i m friends with an infj guy amp i hit it off with him really quickly before i knew his type i am so having that issue too and logic says what is the point but ni is too focused to care very annoying weird feeling type i have found certain types easier to connect to as if it more natural def gonna be very uncomfortable because you re not used to doing it so early on i sure don t do you know this person type doing right by others is easy natural even the struggle is doing right by me had to come back amp retweet because it keeps coming to mind why do we do this to ourselves even when we know better geez perhaps ni goes on an adventure that ti can girl i feel ya it might actually be okay if it equaled some form of productivity in the end ha kind of like blood type o i can give to all but take only from my small close circle um ouch lol seriously tho don t accept the applause of men and you won t be destroyed by their criticism there infinite wisdom in that statement people tend to stop listening to me long before i m done speaking it kind of sad when we end up accepting that just how it is plus with fe we are used to putting our feelings aside often choosing rather to focus on someone else i don t think infjs typically like to rely on others emotionally maybe because we don t think people care or we re independent almost every day why do we do this to ourselves i concur takes conscious effort for sure very needful for us tho or we get ourselves into trouble sad but true idealism smh what can i say i ve learned some hard lessons the long way around haha amp i m so much happier for it might as well share wedefinitely believe this as we are always striving to become a better version of ourselves it better to do something imperfectly than to do nothing flawlessly gotta work on thatmentality intjs use ni te fi se that the infj function stack in the pic i used to too you can grow amp it can get better now i know it their problem not mine so it more annoying than hurtful if you believe it will work out you ll see opportunities if you believe it won t you ll see obstacles this is one of the best amp deepest descriptions on the infj personality type that i ve found thoughts anyone i m often indecisive because i see multiple sides to everything all or nothing obsessed or uninterested get it done or procrastinate i don t typically do anything half way you re a lot stronger than you think practice setting boundaries i had to learn to be more assertive amp i am so thankful that i did you decide what you allow just always remember their behavior is a reflection of their character not yours it never defines you only them where your focus there always something to be happy about if we ll really look which can be a challenge at times maybe remind her of your love amp support as her friend regardless of your personal opinion when you feel like sharing it any takers odd right an encounter i had today made me think some infjs must be mistyped tho the online tests can type wrong we are able to think very logically yet willing to disregard logic if our intuition tells us otherwise so guilty we try to be the love amp give the attention we never received especially to the broken or the underdog as anespecially it is very important that we learn to set healthy boundaries from the outside looking in it hard to understand from the inside looking out it

infj,when you ve felt the most productive you ve been in a long time since depression and still get made to feel like it wasn t good enough capricorns tend to think about what could go wrong rather than right so true wish more people understood this capricorns may act tough but have a big heart a capricorn first instinct about someone is usually correct capricorns try to make others happy sometimes sacrificing their own happiness an introvert desire for solitude is more than just a preference it is crucial to our health and happiness capricorns usually prefer to handle things on their own expectations can lead to disappointment and they don t have time for that so this explains why i always like to stay up all night and why i hate the sun capricorn is very faithful probably the most faithful of the zodiac signs capricorns stay up late every night regret it every morning and then do it all over again capricorn personality is very kind and affectionate but often suppressed by their initial shyness yes i hear you i also read you loud and clear
infj,they re doing what best for them and saving the other from herself swap the ethnicities don t you see bill nye the science guy even though he not a scientist he has science in his name i ve seen people sincerely tweeting about how bill nye the science guy should be a key speaker seriously are they gonna host drum circles there too this is a joke climate change alternative energy mars colonization chimeric organ transplants robotics these are scientific issues i ve seen more scientific discussions in episodes of the clone wars none of these are scientific issues we ll have to wait to hear an official statement in case protestors ofmissed it no that implies self awareness i think sjws amp rd wave feminists are simply ignorant and gullible if it was they d be protesting the sexist oppression of iranian women being forced t not only is the writing awful but the pixel art is that lazy pretentious kind that too common this would be a real prophecy someday a man who had a cameo in home alone will be president someday we will hand our cars over to a mechanic someday democracy will hand the presidency to a complete moron that more of a no brainer so its one of those broad prophecies reminds me of tv psychics using cold reading you might not realize this but the time to use the sound like a conspiracy theorist argument to discredit gamers has passed you re not truly compassionate if the government is forcing you to be compassionate wrong love with bullets is not true love basically socialism and christianity may look similar but they are ultimately like oil and water while rejecting the christian expectation that this compassion not be coerced or forced socialism borrows the compassionate aims of christianity in meeting people needs you were great in pacific rim okay that a new one i strongly disagree silencing any group of people b c of their ethnicity is not progress anti alarm warning leak in the narrative delete delete delete its like watching a crafty guy pick up gullible women protestors you reall business wise donating million to aclu is genius protestors omg lyft like really cares here my money if i ve learned anything from its that lyft knows good publicity when they see it and how to get dumb liberal customers theis just gonna be another farce where thousands litter on the streets and talk about their politics another march under the guise of something else pushed sharia law now thispushes tumblr politics this is why you fail keep your paltry politics the hell out of my the claims that wu claims she was hacked and doxxed come to mind bs claims disproven by the fbi its not just people its white people shouldn t be allowed to give their opinion this coming from an unethical journalist who neither corrected nor updated their post pushing a disproven bs narrative merkel phone must be covered in caked on dark brownish red prints from all the blood on her hands you said remove race but the fact of the matter is that race was singled out in this instance which is the problem in my opinion the margin is wide pick that type of pen vs in my opinion you should try this type of pen saying you shouldn t be allowed to give your opinion on a matter solely b c of your ethnicity is regressive in an open and civil discussion people have a right give their opinions on matters as equals that progress yes because again there is a big difference b w someone telling you what to do and trying to give their opinion its not telling a person the stupid meme itself specifically states try to give their opinion big difference as ifactually cares they re taking advantage of the bad pressis getting from the left nail rain burnt nails used for the roof of a wooden structure found at a site it indicates that a fire caused the roof to collapse sitting there looking like a sad bag of animal feed a stereotype that you pushed holmes remember to post the archive so we don t give unethical dishonest trash any traffic the nonsense that drools out of your skull and onto your keyboard makes you worse than jack thompson ever was yes how darenot kowtow to your ridiculous virtue signaling how dare its drivers try to make a living i have nothing else to say to you since you clearly had no intention of taking this seriously shalom i m against pricks who attack working people b c they don t kowtow to those who demand others share their political views calling for an end to nationalism only shows people that you re fanatical globalists is a big problem uber was never part of your self imposed strike and their drivers immigrants are trying to make a living see that shitty smug attitude of yours won t make anyone want to listen to whatever valid points you re trying to make you need to present your arguments intelligently the country is watching you think chanting end nationalism attacking people for trying to make a living trying to fight innocent police the valid arguments you have are being overshadowed by your idiotic actions the people out there protesting are making the same mistakes they made during the campaign this will have quite the opposite effect and only drive more people away you might find this hard to believe but basically shouting death to nationalism won t endear people to what you say how to get trump a nd term in one vid btw that not a jab at her weight but the fact that she sexually abused her little sister again no the movement was not christian how to roast a pig don t try to shift the focus the point remains that hitler wasn t christian

infj,my thoughts pull me away from reality so easily it scary it makes it hard to focus on what right in front of me there is no time like the present to be present i know an infp who married and one who not he was friends with her brother and just started talking she an enfj i look around and see so many people who have problems much bigger than mine i then tell myself i have no right to feel the way i do the problem with being so intuitive is that i can understand why ppl are hurtful so i tell myself i shouldn t be hurt ya i feel you sounds challenging i am sensitive which doesn t help i feel really good when i can be there for someone people who first reaction is to smile are the best there no such thing as too much love even if it not your love language i would say for other ppl in law i am a calming presence and act as a mediator counselor often just not by parents mom istj dad istp bro intp i m seen as dramatic cuz i don t say i m upset until it now built up don t really see eyeeye if you would bother to ask i would bother to tell people try to love us the best they know how often it isn t the way we want i relate to all of that i think i am a w but it surprising to me to think of myself as peace seeker fam wouldnt agree i know hate conflict and act as mediator often repress anger can be lazy when healthy look more like unhealthy like i guess im trying to figure out if i really am a w i relate to most stuff about but not description of child i was really involved with sports school youth programs as a kid teen like a healthy three then i turned what about u did you have that experience i feel like who i actually am and who i came off as or at least how i was perceived by my parents are entirely different ppl i feel like i showed anger a lot more too as a kid i have a younger brother who i fought with a lot i was more outgoing too cool do you mind if i ask you a question what were you like as a child i sometimes have to remind myself that this is only a chapter of my life not my entire book thanks for the advice often it less what i say but i will save a pin or share something on facebook that hits a nerve don t infjs often avoid developing their fe and so therefore tend to keep things to themselves like fi a lot of the conversations in my head are fights i will never have there is rage beneath the surface that i never show i have a friend who takes my opinions as personal attacks on her life i just want to be me which includes always expanding my opinion i tested as a but based on everything i ve read i relate most to w i despise conflict cool what do you feel like most separates you from other infjs i am often jealous offor their likeability across almost all types hubby is isfj and gets along with almost everyone it funny when ppl want to be infjs to be unique as ani often resent my uniqueness my fe craves connection but ni can be intense cool that what i think i am too this actually makes a lot of sense to me i ve been thinking my isfp friend is probably an enneagram i often feel torn between my family and my spouse i want both to be happy but usually when it comes to family events someone loses ooh that makes sense i could see that thanks for the info but i only have myself to blame my walls are thick and high i prefer to hide instead of showing how broken i am i feel like my family only sees me the way they saw me as a child they don t understand how much of who i was is not who i now am agreed which is why i don t trust tests but the studying of functions lol or do you mean enneagram i m new to that any other out there i just read a piece on personality junkie that says most infjs are when your ni has a vision but is hard to get se there so you take out frustration using fe and while ti is like not a big deal i don t think anything hurts me as much as when people purposefully disconnect me from their life as an when i become depressed i stop feeling anything i become catatonic life is just meaningless what does the learning process look like for you do you feel like all things are possible or do you reject quite a bit we are special not because of our individual qualities but our sum total of who we are some days i feel melancholy for no particular reason it like i lean into the darkness when you become suddenly aware of how meaningless your existence is to someone else but they had an impact on your life when you stare in the mirror trying to see into your own soul sometimes when i zoom out and see the big picture the weight of how small and insignificant i am it almost too much to bear mymom is planning my child birthday party becauseget stuff done my little brother is anhe is clearly the person with the highest iq in my family and he knows it too when i m having a conversation in my head and randomly blurt out things like anyways or nevermind or that nice i m sitting in a restaurant deep in thought when suddenly aware that i m overeating it hard to be present sometimes intuition is a very powerful thing more powerful than intellect steve jobs is this why i m never happy i m a victim of my own mind some days i amaze myself others i walk into a door i m not addicted to drugs or alcohol i m addicted to escaping reality unknown i parent by looking at the big pic is what i m teaching you today going to help you to be a better adult i often feel like i fluctuate between being emotionally cold logical to being overly emotional there is no middle for me i feel sometimes torn between wanting to look nice have nice things and thinking that material things looking good doesn t matter i wish i lived in a society where my talents are easily identified and clear cut like on theshow myfriend has a very unique and unapologetic style i am envious of how free she seems doesnt worry what others think often i feel so lost in my thoughts that i am blind to the world around me i wonder what it like to be anor when i struggle to type someone i feel at a loss of how to connect with them based on their functions does anyone else stock someone i meet someone and i think we could be friends so i creep social media i thought it was normal to stress passing a stranger on the sidewalk do i say hi do i look away nope social anxiety all i can be is me haven t been single in many years but i use to try to be cool chill funny goofy so i would make fun of laugh at myself i like aprils humor from parks and rec i wouldn t be like her in person but i found her morbid jokes funny of the time are so awesome they are more curious about the world than i am we can just talk and learn from each other i never lived in a dorm i use to fantasize about living on campus and making friends with my roommates bahaha i know better now hubby is always looking out and taking care of me he focuses on the here and now so i can focus on the big pic and future my mil is anshe is always creating something new some blanket or doll clothes or something the lone adventurer that would be my dad if there was ever a zombie apocalypse you d want him there my fil is anhe often gets embarrassed by his crazy ideas of life but it doesn t seem crazy to me at all i just get it i m new to enneagram i m still learning but it seems like we ve had similar thoughts i try to avoid negative emotions too i wondered that too when becomes unhealthy they start to be like unhealthy clingy pessimistic sensitive etc so me have you tried reading about type they are very similar to type two but different motives i always test as but i am

intj,you can t see the curlers i have in but the apron is working wonderfully the ceiling fan under the florescent light to create a sticky strobe is a bold design choice at this subway yes i purchased this while watching season for the first time this month i know i know this would make cutting deficit way easier national not attention this surprisingly affordable laundry folder clearly cut cost by leaving out spaces must save a fortune on typesett you can email me via sure where if only we had any historical precedent to predict this kind of thing oh you mean the actions that led to the near depression and was then blamed on dems that greed oh snap reagan or further but it not about the leaders really money and media before i assume i think nuclear devastation would probably be a class equalizer yep but i m not sure if that comes before or after the nukes i can t disagree with that and inciting fear about terrorism and declaring obama a muslim was a huge catalyst fox news and the republican party which built a platform on fear based on lies that ultimately backfired oh i forgot already those were illegal votes i believe that will be the first entry in the newspeak dictionary i ve had my issues with the electoral college before but seeing a win while losing pop vote by m is rare yeah we re fucked and i m saying that as a white male and somehow still many support him not a majority but he didn t need that to be set loose here anyway discredit jail and ultimately demolish the press remove opposition within government cast doubt on the election process every single move they ve made has been straight out of the authoritarian playbook literally step by step well the dow finished at a record high which doesn t really help the that much beyond that no whoever currently covering thetwitter account is a good sport i ve worked customer service with assholes like me i feel like finding a young person just so i can regale them with stories of rotary telephones you kids don t know how lucky i ve scraped and archived all govt climate change info still around hopefully many will republish if it removed jebus just realized i m old enough to be grateful for speakerphone while on hold lobby for a bigger budget to cut wait times to less than an hour i d vote for that though i m sure it been tried on hold with mnsure help line and for minutes i ve been listening to ads for mnsure redundancy remember the uproar among conservatives when obama used executive orders dictator they screamed clamoring to stop him of course trump would work to undermine the voting process we were clearly doing it wrong right thanks trump the miracle you could have used was not falling out of the tree in the first place saved is on hulu my youth no joke and climate change information is immediately being censored disastrous on a worldwide scale these problems are no longer solvable by the body politic opposition party is impotent chance to avert is gone dropped and broke an unopened bottle of bogle old vine zin in the kitchen saved one glass from the wreckage skål anyone who voted for him thinking this wouldn t lead to fascism is a goddam idiot not

patriotism i liked this country i totally forgot about that p i m going to go ahead and refuse that alternative fact finding millions of non existent illegal voters probably takes precedence over public safety when allocating resources this is all so fucked up i imagine i ll be donning a black bandana and pondering my reflection in a molotov cocktail sooner than later even if only to point to

intj,that few people have endured what jsm did on behalf of our nation and i will admire what pres elect obama said about your father when he was elected i will always admire what your father said about candidate obama and in profiles in courage honor matters more than ideology though some can disagree with your dad on political views he has always been a man of honor i ve had my disagreements buthas always been a man of honor see if you can catch the reference to my favorite afn star when the germans are more accepting of foreign cultures and religions than we are in the us but seriously russian state media tried to contactfor an interview about sec mattis creidings it here bottle rev raleigh in which russian state media turns to thefor information on sec mattis thanks bradley peniston this is exactly the sort of marine we need in the fight against daesh she knows the culture hates daesh very mot yikes i thought we were gutted just a nobel prize winner nbd everyone brings something to the table don t be dismissive of people unfortunately the military is the military and she missed out on one of those special fet teams because she wasn t an officer there are very few pashtun cultural experts in the us and even fewer physically fit enough to wear body armor and walk in the mts we need more people like him for instance would have been excellent to have in afghanistan the kicker he a muslim and he often avoids the issue of asked people asked about his halal mre it a religious thing he says he is so effective in locating terrorists and advising he gets sent to ocs from iraq he serves in baquba iraq when aqi daesh predecessor was at its height his arabic makes him invaluable father is from sierra leone and his mother is from egypt he speaks fluent arabic he enlists in the army and joins i m doing interviews and i meet this captain he from sierra leone and he immigrated to the united states grew up in the bronx story time so there i was a battalion xo and i m helping screen candidates to serve as the hhc commander in an aviation battalion friendly reminder from a general with a princeton phd in int l relations not yet sir but may do so tonight and if i remember correctly read it in he drew a hot tub on the flight deck or something i like how in your father book they ask him to draw a picture of a carrier ok point taken on that oh yeah reason i bring up algeria is because of fln tactics read more in savage war of peace okay enough talk gym time in short islamophobia will only backfire and fuel extremism daesh can point at the us and say we were right even though muslims are not monolithic they come from all over the world overreach like muslim bans or islampphobia in the us draws recruits to their cause daesh does not want muslims to assimilate in us even though in iraq and syria it mostly other muslims taking the fight to daesh in the case of al qaeda and daesh they want the us to view this as a clash of civilizations west vs islam they try to push the moderates to either side they try to provoke a reaction that causes the powerful to overreach they cause division revolutionaries hate moderates because moderates look for reasoned peaceful solutions i ve been studying insurgency for the better part of years do you know what militant groups really love let look at algeria in that not even the most awesome a oxcart ftw strategists from napoleon to mattis agree torture doesn t work via not gonna lie i totally drink lacroix to read mexico matters fromin ah the good old days when we worked alongside our mexican partners via that sounds great but we have a perfect track record of predicting future threats perfectly wrong hidden in there is talk of how the army lowered standards did not chapter enough troops etc then if you can find it the chiarelli report on army suicides circa i think i saved on google docs also a few links to read first this parts links at bottom we pick a strategy that fits the prevailing political financial landscape not the other way around we like to think we align ways and means to meet ends but in practice it the other way around just like in the late when we thought we could get away with precision weapons air power sof etc better thinking is always a good thing but you simply can t replace people that easily like now there are promotion rates in the low for ltc so basically the post officers but i think the net result of say was positive beyond that it got very dicey we still have long lead times for simple chapters multiple pt test failure takes a year to enforce began holding company commanders accountable for enforcing standards lower level commanders in theset the tone it needed to raise standards and it had x duis and no chapter paperwork was initiated so blame goes to both the army but also actually when he was usareur commander drilled down and found many soldiers who then in those chapters rose again as the army started to crack down again obesity etc chapters for height weight and pt test failure plummeted in by appx in net result was it made it much harder to separate a soldier for misconduct pt failure i have plenty of charts sitting around on my computer but basically the army issued a message in general but pt was one of them perhaps k but organization of the active force matters as well armor infantry medium bigger than the army of k smaller than the k of the war when there were problems also sounds like yoda speak object subject verb i think around k i think correctable to also prk surgery

apply to university in nonuscountry doesn t help professor in university wants you email them helps am just a nobody doing what i can in a small capacity if you re in a better position to help please help people futures are at stake apply to a university in nonuscountry vs this prof in this university in this country is looking for phd candidates write to them and i passed them on to my friends now they are not nonfunctional they re taking actions to continue their education career some nice people who saw my earlier post regd friends at dartmouth offered me leads on universities companies they could apply to and i know a few others so yes stop telling me not to overreact this is not called being political this is c yeah i actually told some of my friends to look into phd programs in canada might send some your way for info advice yup fortunately canadian friends are giving me details passing them on to my iranian friends we re all living a nightmare honestly not exaggerating when i say we re all emotionally drained and scared he legitimized hate and bigotry when bush and cheney seem like reasonable rational individuals bruh i just saw this under foreign policy i think i really wantright now same feels when i saw that term still can t wrap my head around the many many ways they promoting hate yeah and also bigotry is bigotry no matter how euphemistically one puts it this we can try to pretend that our little field is immune but when politics becomes hostile to science it affe same difference senpai see something that bad and make it not bad lt shrug gt to everyone saying that twitter activism achieves nothing here you go sometimes nice things happen in a shitty i am being reminded of this tweet over and over again the past days prof and almost everyone except people in the group us citizens but they feel ecosystem not conducive so want to move the agenda was to discuss whether people had family obligations etc in the us and whether they d be open to moving out of us yeah i think i m still in shock denial hasn t sunk yet that wasn t empty talk friend research group had a meeting today i ve been tweeting as and when i m seeing hearing things i just saw the progression of this thread in its entirety and shit general sentiment they don t want science they discriminate us we re smart and others want us let just go elsewhere and work in peace this is not one isolated professor serious talks going on b w advisors and phd students to move out of us i honestly can t process this if you dec it the policy of the us government to deport my phd students then deport me first scott aaronson precisely why i m afraid goal here is to show that n is a large number so they have an agenda to unfairly accuse prosecute yeah they are in the middle of their programs course credits not always transferrable tuition living expenses loss etc i feel that i have it less shitty not from iran but when friend called me crying asking what to do it broke my heart it is honestly disappointing that it has come to this awww the feeling is mutual it is always good to meet more experienced women in the field and learn from them can relate to this situation more than you d imagine i don t know about others but my friends were worried about visas being revoked and or being denied re entry if they leave etc told advisor today i was scared about my visa status don t worry we ll protect you wouldn t be functional now if he hadn t said that
intj,quand je regarde les supporters de trump débattre dans mes mentions she blocked me as well and i don t even know who is she or didn t talk to her bref ch ais pas je crois que j vais essayer d arrêter de les comprendre le point de départ c est ma dernière photo en lingerie puis j sais pas ils ont enchainé sur les bijoux de mains j aime faire preuve de bonté avec les haters ils en manquent cruellement ah bon ok donc nouvelle shitstorm je sais pas pourquoi mdr les gens please trouvez vous des occupations ok cool ok thanks ffffffuck and i want to thankfor telling me about this shitty brand alors perso je commanderai plus jamais chez eux voici des marques du même style qui ne sont pas des grosses merde donc la marque c est honey birdette mais il faut savoir que vous êtes beaucoup à me demander d où vient cet ensemble j ai appris trop tard que la marque était une grosse merde avec ses employées i m in love with this and i need it in my life if you have too much money faux une fois que j ai fini je renfile mon jogging direct d i ve lost some followers because of my anti trump tweets too bad they re missing this le lien tw racisme tw mort non mais attendez c est vrai ça ah ben j avais jamais vu sans cuir et ça coûte une blinde ils sont sérieuuuux aww tu me flattes rare pic of me smiling by co worker you remind of those girls with tattoos and funny hair color who do photos me don t see what you re talk thank you aww me too thank you that really sweet but i m wearing makeup in this pic j viens d acheter pulls chez celio pour la même raison c est pour le boulot ça rentre pas dans ma poche pareil looking my old cosplays instead of making new ones motivation not found just a wig idk i was missing my red hair
intj,first he ll say the aclu is overrated and will be cancelled soon then he ll say ca beaches aren t great one more domino in the gop it is my understanding that it for people who are dual citizens of other ok one domino drops member of gop stands up against the insanity the gop is the only hope americans have left two national protests in lt days hmmm let see whatanddo here i thought so as well but don t want to take any chances with funny law no i don t even have an iranian passport thanks jason that helpful sure could use hitch and his wisdom right now interesting and awful thanks am curious if holding a us passport will allow me to enter or not now very curious about this since i m on goes tsa pre check any legal guidance is appreciated uhhh yikes so even if i hopped up to vancouver i d be at risk lovely twitter friends any lawyers know how i find out if i m considered a dual citizen or not as far as i know i m only a us citizen but man what great cell service minutes intopodcast learned so much more about you and so agree with your approach to life and people thanks scott have heard many views around basic income what is a solid source to read about pros cons similar reaction to original promoted tweets same person lead execution on both that skill has surely deteriorated so you re saying i m no longer the best hah as in new leaders need to emerge soon he can get the ear of politicians on both sides as seems people not supportive of this administration are lacking their middle management w my question would be who is directing that energy from the protests marches rallies int the thread is broken was this in response to the musk tweet so what needs to happen for tillerson to become potus if there any truth to this it would be the greatest gift to us all ugh pardon the typo was a thread was him and collision brothers thank youfor saying what should seem obvious by now ok then well ca and ny are the states that can stand up to trump for the sanctuary cities this should be intere oh the jordan millers reconnect yup spot on on your part the article uses maury maury maury this cannot be real to block traffic i ve been saying putin is playing chess and we re playing checkers but this guy explanation is way better she right this gives me hope the new administration has the dictionary feeling extra sassy serious question is there anything the dems can do to stop the gop right now se speaking for a nation are there any ways to stop the gop right now republicans pass bill to bar insurance coverage for abortion well unfortunately that means the end of npr funding see below or above you forgot to insert the troll emoji they might take your question seriously then maybe they re not great entrepreneurs maybe melania will start the downfall of trump she ll get sick of him and his shtick and just tell us everything looks more like one million a nice wake up call for msm or so i hope a historian breaks down why there no trump resistance nothing to see here move along let talk about crowds and it silly to be even talking about attendance what people should care about is the idea of alternative facts if only that wasn t a subtweet is this what people do in retirement listen mark you give us what we want i hope something like that can at least give you a good laugh also hope you re well true but i m curious if she has just suddenly become a religious person to help her political aspirations if i understood your wit my apologies yes you did say that but you also said us is people who oppose trump so wouldn t his words mean he is with us folks in tech who have worked for with carly curious if she is a religious person or not yes and that tweet is obviously a joke so would it be fair to argue that ari fleischer was opposing trump with the tweet that started this thread curious who is it that you include in us it has taken less than hours for his reality distortion field to makeand h t my new favorite phrase look forward to using it in as many meetings as i can as long as both sides keep thinking us and them were not making progress

intj,me too it took years to collect things and stuff and it doesn t go away over night something that needs to be done ongoing also check outthis is an extreme example of minimalism but it hints at the ideas decluttering is more about getting rid of things and stuff but also thoughts and emotions that no longer have a place check out some of the episodes of this podcast it great on another note perhaps intellectualism correct meant in a collective macro inclusive manner we also need them if we feel too robot we might forget our humanity then we might forget that humanity needs us typo which is caring and understanding for the suffering of others empathy is the ability to experience the feelings of another person it goes beyond sympathy i treat others how i presume i might want to be treated which is with alone time in seriousness i think i m emphatic but not necessary sympathetic this is how nts comfort people in emotional need intj agrees i found a story on fowl energy a city used chicken poop to power their energy grid i used to identify as intx because i was always between j p over time i am definitely j or at least that what i think heaven or hell is what we make in this reality not an esoteric place used as a reward punishment for what we do in this life fantastic site spent the past hour reading random articles one thing i am curious about is what your mbti thanks if you had the time of your life i hope you didn t put that baby in a corner double dirty dancing reference i hear you i value all my relationships but want to add nt to diversify my quality of interactions maybe intps are less noticeable because they are in the corner analyzing while entps are center stage arguing i find entps detectable too when they re around but profession wise i rarely encounter them maybe it easier for nts to blend into the sensor world and nfs stand out more and are more detectable statistically there should be enough of us out there but we can t find each other there needs to be an nt public directory book i m searching for nts but they are elusive i can find nfs at every street corner it appears maybe nts can t detect other nts as easily after seeing the last one i can relate it seems more like a part made for tv episode and not a feature film i have only met a female intj and entp in real life i have yet to meet an intp each time really isn t that different from any other the haziness of the past allows us to forget the present isn t all that different watching tv programming from a time is a glimpse into the collective pop culture hopes dreams fears and determination of an era watching american tv programming over the past week common themes doomsday by h bomb going to space and playing cards at friends on my account i always try never to burn a steak what i perceive when i meet anin the wild umm i was thinking more voodoo or the kind of occult power from thriller but witchcraft is a viable hypothesis happened during transition of accounts between incoming and outgoing accounts twitter bug anyone that ever followed and unfollowed the account historically was someone re followed the arrow and the song by henry wadsworth longfellow it interesting when an analysis of a line poem is pages in length i m watching movies from the with actors born in the that people born years ago and i can see them walking and talking better or worse are relative i m sure in they thought i the pop culture of was odd i spent hours yesterday listening to an aqua playlist good times i liked the tune to cartoon heroes yeah it like meeting another fellow endangered species that happens to also collect stamps or vintage victorian hats i think over of intjs fall into subtypes and w are definitely a highly representative sub type of the the invisible hand gives you a high five xp anything that exists only exists as the culmination of all of the causes and conditions that make that thing exist the shadow of the thing is not the same as the thing itself plato allegory of the cave congrats on that and i m sure you will continue to learn more over time great videos too by the way i have watch many yes it hard to reject the symbols labels and stories of our society in order to find meaning in something deeper i like the thought to take whatever values you have to be a better whatever you are regardless of whatever you happen to be i will take a look thank you or maybe i m lost the functional minimalist is great very short episodes and practical advice she reminds me of you and listening is a requirement to be heard no the original post about if everyone blocked djt on twitter meant no one would hear him most all religions have similar core values that promote humanist values was drawn to the secular view because it doesn t require the buyin of the traditional extrinsic symbols as theistic religion it can be a religion philosophy a psychology some of those things all of those things or none of those things there are many perspectives in buddhism as there are in judisam christianity or islam mindfulness and gratitude have resulted in an awakening like the tint on my glasses has changed the way i perceive the world this is the first time since i can remember to not be happy but free happiness is a result of freedom and not the goal i have a number of degrees great job and all the thing that should make you happy but in fact i was very unhappy this then lead me to read eastern teachings specifically in secular buddhism and view minimalism as a philosophy found fantastic podcast at that lead me to a see a more moderate view as being more practical for my life style in the past month i came across the minimalist documentary which i see as an extreme of the minimalist life style i ll just go gnaw on a tree until i feel better be right back think an orange versus a can of coke both have comparable levels of sugar but very different overall true but natural raw form alternatives are generally safer than human made chemical compounds aspirin and several other compounds are grandfathered and if discovered today would never pass fda trials easily yes safer probably not in order to be heard one has to listen it like the old if a tree falls in the woods saying you need to see this movie it sums up your photo well the path to happiness and freedom is not in material objects but has and always has existed within yourself i add a bit of pepper for uptake and add boiling water to make a tea it not too bad but yes in cold water is gross turmeric is a fantastic anti inflammatory teaspoons has the medicinal effect of regular strength aspirin when i m around other cats my cat can tell and she knows i ve been cheating in a class of your own without attribution too please just

intj,editing a portrait aww thanks alex heh heh heh but seriously finally done with the edit for shotgun girl o closed a big editing loop today at the cafe the rest is denouement thanks would love to hear your thoughts lt ha no way i would have never guessed we thought about doing it but i don t think my hots talents are good enough to make it worthwhile silver right now this post is also available for the first time ever in podcast format come listen to me get brave and real honest here how i grew my compassion and people skills by practicing gratitude and patience i said over the years i d grown beyond some of the negative aspects but didn t really explain how well today i thought i d tell you two years ago i posted about the struggles and glories of my meyers briggs type something personal and vulnerable and positive something i really believe in stay tuned i m fighting back the best way i can as a creator i m still creating and i m determined to share something new with you tomorrow what happening right now is so upsetting and frightening i m struggling to engage with all of it and maintain hope to that effect i m so sorry that happened to you sometimes people suck uh oh what on earth could i be doing with this she d made a deal with the devil and blood money was all he paid today i joined the resistance a lovely poem by beautiful thank you omg that is amazing too late saaaame today editing session leaves me via page count and via content in the last chapter but it needs a complete rewrite turns one into either a god or a monster what the difference perspective those interviews were adorbs totally in awe of your guys composure done with page count done with content getting closer i can t tell if i m laughing or open mouthed in horror chris is playing memory hole videos on youtube and he won t stop my problem is i react so logically i may say something incredibly insensitive bc i m focusing on ideas not people emotions very good thread about different perspectives on reading the same book especially when it problematic just really enjoyed how you named something i didn t have a name for thank you i admire how you said you have a tendency to not be thoughtful i suffer the same but haven t heard it put that way before saaaaaame cats for lyfe isn t it funny how it the same story but mostly different words nah that shit is scary i would have acted the same whaaaaaaaaaaaaaaat it the one i ll be querying with next month hopefully the one code named shotgun girl done with this edit via page count and done in terms of work left to do how to name henchmen a guide i really need right now love alex answer to the first question on how creativity manifests for people differently i know what you mean exactly i don t like being the supporting cast or like this is the parallel universe the main characters would visit and get to leave at the end of the story i feel like we accidently got routed to a parallel universe if you find assholes in every room you enter maybe you re the asshole what does that last word say i can t make it out foe she calls hers ribbons of blood mine seem to be rivers of tears inspired by i thought i d show you the editing process for shotgun girl so far blue marks a change sweet gif omg ending the day pages further in this edit than yesterday had to walk around and look out the window for a while to get that second hour i think because i write on my lunch break i accidentally trained myself to only write for an hour then transition hours k new words a chapter stitched back together this is the end of my attention span but i insist on breaking through if mia had one it would read i lie about not being fed even to the one who just fed me i guess she not very bad these cat shaming pictures are hilarious lt so fun we didn t get any so cold at the cafe i m wearing my full coat and scarf might have to glove up if the tea doesn t warm me ending my first week back on pounds lost in november i was diagnosed with depression read about the radical changes that brought to my life here in reference to my earlier retweet even though i m not adding many words this is work too essential work to get on track spent this hour reading through my story beginning to ensure consistency before brainstorming a rewrite of the next part this post gave me strength when i needed it yesterday

infp,hahaha naw it was said in fun no ill intent you re such a little baby you just believe the best in people and take everyone word at face value told by an when your friend keeps changing all the songs you like it when he telling jyn what her father told him about redeeming himself my favorite quote in the movie is by him and i really wish i could find it verbatim somewhere or i ll wait for the dvd you say naive i say idealistic actually i think it might be that i ve always just had a crush on the girl characters so i choose to play them hahaha i know and i was allllwwaaays princess peach and sometimes toad or princess daisy sonya blade i always liked playing the girl like in street fighters chun li was my gal hmm this is kind of hard the beast tommy pickles charlie bucket luke skywalker nicholas harbourne in th grade i refused to do the finale presentation i knew i would still get an a in the class if i took a zero i felt so rebellious the scent of a distant fireplace is so captivating i ve had several almost relationships i didn t want to lead them on if they didn t live up to the ideal person i guess at least it almost the weekend everyone says this is real life not a movie but it could be if we put ourselves out there and take chances don t settle for dull i like black tea but decaf what the point happy birthday celeste didn t want to tell her either she wanted her to guess she wanted her to ask all the right questions but she never did maybe not the i ll go for nfj i want to be a dad like jack with a wife like rebecca i can see beauty in imperfections but i can also see imperfections in beauty i want to this one is cheeky and it my fave this is us makes me want to be a parent i think of it as like a i m proud or smiling from ear to ear and the other one as like a flattered blush or warm feels i m like a kid in a candy store he said that in a movie once if people asked me to run and i had the means to do so i probably would just to make a difference but no desire otherwise the meeting was all numbers and charts meanwhile i was planning my lunch for tomorrow and trying not to fall i m eating halloween candy from two years ago i was born on a tuesday who said the leaders have to be political haha i think world history needed a few moreleaders can you imagine the difference i believe it when someone asks why are you still single i ll just start saying umm i m an infp haha same haha let bring this look back me too i judge pizza by how stringy the cheese is this wine label tho i m going to get it next time i m in monday you can hold your head tuesday wednesday stay in bed or thursday watch the walls instead it friday i m in love it hip to be says who haha nope no i was born in for sure i wish i could visit decades yes haha i love that song and the i want an montage to the song nothing gonna stop us now their whole album talking is hard is so good i m wearing a really soft sweater today i wanted to stay home and sleep so this will have to do haha so far my favorite song of all time is aquaman by walk the moon before that it was stand by me by ben e king something beyond how was your day or where did you go to school something so random and trivial that they just want to know to know for once i d like someone to ask me something about myself with the sole purpose of getting to know me on a deeper level me trying to sort out feelings i kind of liked the ending i have an issue of putting people on pedestals and viewing myself as subordinate i feel like people don t want to invest in friendships anymore unless they render some sort of return i don t think i get stressed easily and if i do i think i handle it well i finally saw episode of season of black mirror it was so good i don t think i do i usually just say my prayers and curl up next to my dog perhaps more i didn t want to over exaggerate haha i ve lived imaginary lives with different people reminded me of you i m not a huge ed sheeran fan but his two new songs are his best so far from what i ve heard is this the place we used to love is this the place i ve been dreaming of
infp,how many terror attacks have refugees carried out in the united states none cnn taking a break from the hard stuff to watch my manshoot pointers i think you re preaching to the choir here i agree if trump thinks it in the best interest of the country to start a nuclear war should we all just sit quietly amp say he the boss there free speech your pastor has the right to talk about whatever he or she wants you should give jesus more power trump less loving the least among us will forever be a church issue what the heck is the role of the church if not to love the least among us you act like trump is the almighty king we can t question i m saying that choosing to care and act on behalf of people in crisis is not a state issue it a human issue it a love issue this is absurd you re gonna tell a group of refugees that you can t help them because it would be mixing the two your pastor is for sure in a position to encourage his church to show up and love people jesus was big on that stu those refugees and immigrants are god children there is no two kingdoms this is about people in need deep down you know that you re in some serious denial it a moment when millions are being discriminated against it a moment for the church to love you speak to who is in the room it starts with us caring and with encouraging people to care and act this is not about democrat versus republican it about loving people who are in crisis was it the left who said to love your enemy and to care for the least among us oh wait no that was jesus this ain t about politics do you know any muslims have you met any refugees my hunch is you would start to believe better things no trump won because of a bullshit private server story and because of russia involvement and because of fear suggests that a person running from fire might be fire a person running from fire is seeking a solution to the fire let help because this isn t about democrat versus republican it about people who have lost everything and they re searchi i m gonna keep making it along with millions of other people this is the nature of free speech and democracy if i have to choose between offending someone who voted for trump and offending someone who is fleeing violence that an easy choice the truth matters compassion matters standing up to racism amp discrimination matters refugees matter this is abo i don t speak out against trump because he a republican i speak out because bad ideas are bad ideas bad idea this isn t just something it closer to everything at the moment i m saying this is an important moment in history and every leader on the planet should be addressing it thanks my friend you re awesome i appreciate the kind words i spent days in iraq last month and the only hate i came close to was the hate these folks are trying to escape because refugees amp immigrants deserve more than better safe than sorry if you were in a crisis imagine being to jesus said to love our enemies you should follow my friendand his work with typo dig into the facts not the fear because jesus said to love our neighbor and to care for the least among us i think today news relates to both and today ban affects more than million people the church should care and show up anyone in need anyone hurting afraid tired poor jesus said to love people and to love the least among us and i think being a leader means leading when it isn t easy when the situation is messy is great example if you don t know what to say start by saying that but we can t ignore it and this moment didn t come out of nowhere we are a nation of immigrants read the words on the statue of liberty my twitter feed is rooted in helping people who are hurting at the moment politics intersects that to care about mental health is to care about people to care about people is to care about anything that affects people including politics twloha is based on helping people who are hurting but you re offended by me saying we should try to help refugees this isn t about republican versus democrat it about human decency it about compassion it about loving peo politics comes from a greek word that basically means cities which means people my work has a lot to do with today at jfk there was a suicide attempt by a woman being deported you can t care about mental health and not car i visited a syrian refugee camp in iraq last month and listened as women talked about struggling with depression a the word politics basically translates to anything that has to do with people jesus came to be with people not refugees are people on the run from terrorists they aren t a problem they are people desperately seeking a soluti when the latest news is one of the most important moments of our lifetime and it affects tens of millions of peop then don t think of it as politics think of it as loving people in need pretty sure jesus talked about that if you go to church tomorrow and the pastor doesn t talk aboutyou might want to find a different church this moment matters when we turn people away we miss out on their story and you cannot claim to love someone if you have no interest in their story a person mental health has a lot to do with their circumstances so if we care about mental health we have to care about circumstances i just watched this three times this is what a great america looks and sounds like so cool it kinda like well yes mister troll we can have this conversation but i want you to meet thousand of my cl regarding trolls i either block them or i think of their mean tweet like a pitch quote that thing and hit it out of the park yes great news but it gonna be a marathon one day at a time actually my american friend has lived there with his kids for the last years they re safe and happy you seem this little girl father was killed by isis her family welcomed and fed me in iraq but donald trump says they re this photo was taken last month in iraq according to donald trump none of these kids are welcome in america wow rooting for you guys as you get started in india peace to you from far away thanks for the work you re alrea we are on a mission to unmake violence itself with preemptive love what i need most most for my kids to be well is for my middle eastern friends to be well we are regularly hosted and protected by the people of the middle east an american who has lived in iraq for the last yrs
infp,you re laughing but you re sad you can t ask someone what wrong if they re laughing but you knew that didn t you i am watching you i am listenning to your voice and how you hide your face when you laugh don t do that you are so beautiful i crave vulnerability and raw emotion and intimacy and honesty and trust but i can t even make eye contact a lot of people trust me with their darkest secrets and i ve yet to know or understand why other than the fact that i ll always listen i m trying i m trying to be okay i m trying not to notice everything that isn t okay i m trying please see that i m trying hello people i d be very grateful if you could answer or share my short survey it would really help me out wonder which mug is mine my colleagues just think i leant on the keyboard haha its actually spencer quoting winnie the pooh so technically it winnie the pooh doesn t feel good about going out cancels plans doesn t feel good about cancelling plans feels like the worst person on earth repeat she used to be mine waitress the musical on a night out i like to sit outside and listen to the bass from a different perspective it a different world in there it the script for perks of being a wallflower the film version of perks of being a wallflower it from the film version of perks of being a wallflower sometimes summoning up enough motivation to do even the things i want to do can be a challenge america i m going to try my best to trust that you saw a goodness in trump that i couldn t please be safe x how lucky am i to have something that makes saying goodbye so hard person don t forget to bring it tomorrow i won t i reply almost definitely lying when somebody tells you a secret and you have to pretend you didn t already know but you don t know how you knew in the first place if i open up to you you have about minutes until i deeply regret it and apologise for wasting your time i may seem distant i may seem uncomfortable i may seem like i want to be anywhere else but here but i never stopped listenning i lose people because i m so private they don t think that i trust them maybe i don t maybe i don t trust anybody but i still love you me simply listenning to someone talking friend comes up behind me and whispers i m so proud of you me i love you somehow in a cryptic nonsensical way this means that i love you very much i wish you could understand that meaning that one day i will love and care for you and the next you will have a very hard time even contacting me i hate inflicting myself on people but i also have to know that the people i love are okay this oxymoron does not work in my favour the feelings and emotions of the people i love feel to me like an extention of my own nobody seems to believe the extent of this hoping that the person who ignoring my messages doesn t accidentally read the message and feel the need to reply if they don t want to i consider myself to be an honest person and yet the projection of myself that i show the world is an unconscious lie do you like spoken word slam poetry i love to be alone i think this is because i can t be myself around people but there a few who i feel i can be and with them i am alone sorry don t say that what are you sorry for i think it an infp paradox i d love to be genuinely known by someone and yet somehow it so impossibly rare each to their own although i don t particularly think it a choice it seems we re just inherently enigmatic everybody filling me up with noise i don t know what they re talking about see all i need a whisper in a world that only shouts i think i am sick but never can be certain still call up my mother hiding behind curtains don t make me go don t make me go outside i did my best to assure her but assurance isn t easy to give when you ve never been sure of anything much and less so the longer you live an interesting poem about being introverted show me the truest representation of you that you have to offer and i promise not a fraction of you will i judge i m sorry that sometimes you can t see the fire inside of me but it has long learnt that some people like to piss on it how very poetic do you ever just listen to someone talking or watch someone laughing and think i want everyone to know you are you sure about this are you have you ever been sure no doctor who this is what my brain says my face and my body say something else i wish i could follow my own advice the problem is that i love people to the extent that i miss them painfully but i also can t inflict my problematic presence on those i love i often care too much sometimes a loved one problem still effects me long after they themselves have forgotten about it common misconception that infp actually show others their over sensitive vulnerable side it very rare for me if anybody has any mbti questions etc ask away i don t like to be told i have to change if i feel the decision wasn t consciously mine i will not be able to get motivated enough always being criticised for not knowing what going on on the news i m insensitive i do not like having to embrace reality
infp,i ve had a headache all day honestly sometimes i wish i could record my outloud commenting bc it sarcastic as heck amp i say some pretty epic things i ve reached the climax of bates hotel and i am so done i commentated the show outloud as i was watching the ep but i need to rant still too bad this guy is older and probably married by now i d totally marry him amp his cat he seems awesome trying not to be a hypochondriac as i recall the symtoms for flu on the news amp realise i ve had a little headache amp weird body aches lately dishes vacuuming w the new heavy vacuum cleaner and having to clean up stuff that isn t mine i dislike all chores really such well that depressing which mbti types can handle infps darkness sometimes moody amp prone to periods of depression or self doubt but also springing back again hugs two intjs boom cosmic force sweeps the universe matthew lewis is still my harry potter cast crush it just like that northern accent though exactlyy it means like an alternative of something like an animal that super fluffy look at all that floof floof is my new favorite word i hope so this is me xd are there any examples in particular that make you at a loss doesn t make sense to you sass is one thing my ears will never be too feeble to hear young man at least i can start my ba and go from there so you ve been in school for awhile how has it worn on you so far don t shush your elders it would be nice if they were gap moe sometimes but yeah maybe it not always like this if they re close to person i m older than you though i guess i am still young amp hope i ll go far i ve already begun thanks i need heck yeahs spread periodically through out my life to keep the doubts at bay do i it is coincidental and thank you i m pretty sure that accurate what about you stayed in my pjs all day the rest of the weekend have to use up coupons at a store amp for ice skating homework chores she mention you a lot xd we talk about more than just mbti on here so yes i hope it will be interesting for you my name is also bri so that made it more entertaining xp update on bates motel dang he killing people left and right every night at about pm i start feeling warm amp cuddly for some reason lately mental health counselor so a master plus about years of supervised experience before licensing test oh my gosh that so hard to only choose i can t did you mention katara though same also a fav hp memory is when my isfp friend amp i messed around singing the mysterious ticking noise one of my best harry potter memories was watching the movies for the st time in w diff people no this guy was a chef fixing up a steak amp sprinkled salt on it like this i really thought it was glitter though lel oh gosh that horrible the guy could be dying or something and they gave the wrong phone number i m sure your relationship will go better than the one in my dream how is istj yes i did haha in some versions i believe he enfp i m in love with him amp peter pan tho and yeah i m kinda like i dated and then broke up with anin the same dream he was controlling amp got mad about me going to church and college what are you doing this friday afternoon i m just in bed looking up the orgin of this meme i thought it was glit what the heck samantha get your act together already it annoying employers keep calling me every once in a while on my iphone asking for a samantha lewis either they got thewrong or she gave them mine i hate feeling vulnerable to be honest math is alien unrelated to my mbti type but i do think infps generally want serious relationships i don t think the normal dating applies to me as an infp bc i have christian standards i m not sure where it came from i asked the person i got it from amp they didn t know i ll look it up though d never enough entjs on twitter welcome really want i want bc i will be spending a good chunk of my years amp money on it i definitely think people are never too old to go to college or pursue what they want but for me i want to make sure this is i ll be at least are you going to go to school to do counseling as well that would be who like change their mind because type shouldn t change after thinking they were a certain type for years like how could you not know especially if you research mbti a lot i can t either it also blows my mind when people discover they have completely opposite cognitive functions than they thought i know that seems the best plan but so many ifs and unknowns and possible mistakes w consequences here we go changing types again i m so done please make sure of your type first before becoming an mbti expert i never was interested in human services i only chose it as a major at my comm college bc they didn t have a psychology major but years ago i was a completely different person heck even yrs ago and yrs from now i will be too and the problem is i can t decide out of the possibilities and i don t like to make a decision until i m sure and i just feel like it will be royally f because i have no idea i have ideas but not one set idea i m not good at setting far plans i feel like i have my current future few months at most

infp,i am woefully susceptible to the beautifully vivid imaginations and fast paced intellect of entps and then the owner catches up to the ne dog and administers some good ol fi scolding for a few months years so what ends up happening is that i get fed up of not fully living break free of fi and do impulsive very un fi things but also i want to run around and be wild and be free of this exhausting fi controlling me and not letting me do things except it both at the same time so i m always controlling myself keeping a tight leash trying to not eat dead birds and you fi have to constantly monitor everything and make sure it isn t going to eat a dead bird or dig up someone garden lol my sister says exactly the same thing for me it more like taking a very boisterous bear sized dog ne for a walk directly contradicts my moral code it always a fight between i have to be good fi and i just want to be alive ne obviously i m biased here but infps can be very paradoxical i often feel like my impulsivity and need for adventure guys thank you for your words they weren t expected and were truly appreciated today was not a good day i made a bad decision that will follow me for a long time and the world hasn t ended and it going to be okay too true thanks i really appreciate that okay everything just became even more awesome that it already was the lumineers are master storytellers omw omw they have the same tattoo because they re the same person please please watch them especially cleopatra sleep on the floor and angela warning you might cry watch angela and sleep on the floor they have the same tattoo ohmygosh so we ve fangirled about this before but today i saw something new while binge watching lumineers music vids thank you for this downsizing policies on climate change whatintends to do will have catastrophic effects worldwide as someone who has a degree in biological science we should not be supporting anyone who thinks global warming is a hoax i m soz for the aggressiveness of this thread but i need to put this out there bc not taking a stand is no longer an option in conclusion please can all trump supporters racists homophobes and misogynists unfollow me if you support him you support his ideals and you support the oppression of millions of people who deserve to be free ignoring the things he himself has said his cabinet consists of people who are sexist racist and homophobic i do not believe thatsupports this mindset and thus i oppose him and his administration i believe that all people should be treated with respect regardless of race gender sexual orient religion or anything else i would rather stand by my beliefs and be shunned than stay silent about things that truly matter to me yesterday i retweeted somethingsaid about not accepting sponsorships from anti lbgt companies i m proud of that ignoring things he himself has said of the people he has appointed many are racist or homophobic i do not condone this i do not believe that thesupports this mindset and therefore i am vehemently opposed to it but i m tired of squashing my beliefs both in real life and on twitter i m tired of trying to keep everyone happy i have something to say in the short time that i ve been here i ve tried to not get political or to offend anyone this made me smile today the song angela terrifies me because it slightly too relatable for comfort and my name is angela my enfp sister is in love for the first time with this hilarious esfj dude and it just the best thing alternate translation don t let your si override your ne no matter how good the idea of peaceful inertia may be esp i hope that you come to love and appreciate your unique and stunning mind in only the way that you can happy for each of you i sincerely hope that is a good and beautiful year and that you are surrounded by amazing people this year i ve decided to choose the word fearless instead of making ny resolutions that will only leave me feeling sad by the second week of jan i like to choose a word each year to embody i m so much more comfortable giving love than receiving it at around pm mysuddenly sits up and says so i ve been having some thoughts imagine you were blind or a tiny giraffe or if the easiest path is most often not a rewarding one i think to keep living is far more terrifying what would you do if you weren t afraid the people i appreciate the most are the people who teach me how to navigate specific bends in my internal labyrinth that a very good point i defs think that fi users are more likely to cheat bc the morality of it is determined independently but the guilt that accompanied these episodes was suffocating and caused me to call people years after and apologise the ability to decide wht is right and wrong internally combined with the option happy ne is a dangerous recipe and i think that in the future i could possibly justify physical cheating tbh it a big fear of mine at the time i was able to justify it to myself and i think that the way i self defined cheating was very fi and defs beyond the point that you would admit to your so but just not doing anything physcial i have definitely emotionally cheated as in getting very intimate and emotional beyond the point of friendship phew its getting harder to talk in hypotheticals here while i have never physically cheated on someone yes true but overall on average i would still go with ps i wonder if fi or fe would be more likely to cheat to distance yourself if a compromise cannot be reached and i did not get along if someone behaviors are destructive to the people around them regardless of mbti you need i would never exclude or distance someone because mbti simply providing explanations as to why this specific individual i would assume that ps over js are more likely to cheat so life sometimes throws these things at u and u think you re going to die and then u don t and u learn something and u repeat intp how to seduce an xnfx i want every part of you selfie with leia the great dane so named because intp dad is star wars fan in which i demonstrate that
infp,i ve gotten a lot of followers lately here a fun poll just for the heck of it if you know your mbti type when you re talking to someone about something you ve put a tremendous amount of research into and they tell you yo maybe i m not like most infps probably every infp who knows about mbti it weird to think that the friends i have never met irl from the internet are real people and not just a picture on my phone screen i ve been thinking about functions allllllll day using personality typing as a way of brushing off a potential mate is also completely defiant of the original intent that so funny using your personality type as an excuse for bad behavior or irresponsibility completely defies the whole point of personality typing did you have a bad istj experience infp istj relationships they be like that sometimes only an infp like me would feel out of place even at a crazy music festival full of unique and weird individuals i feel like i m constantly teaching my istj the bigger picture he was valedictorian of his class but he clueless to say the least the intelligence of an istj is very shallow they only really understand data they don t understand the big picture which is the key like if you even barely stutter it can drive you insane if you like talking about deep subject matter that revolves around the fate of humanity date an istj if you dont like talking about your feelings date an istj if you like having every little speech mishap analyzed and mocked date an istj dating an istj can be frustrating but fulfilling at the same time rare infp moments you won t see on tv i just told off a new girl at work bc she thought she could walk in amp tell me that i m doing dishes tonight guess who isn t doing dishes do you love puns quote this with your mbti type when someone just found out about mbti and tries to tell you about your type negs sometimes we re on different energy levels and want to do different things but we compromise really wel positives being alone but together intellectually stimulating convos unique inside couple humor i m lowkey dating an istj rn it so great omg happy anniversary my children i got quality time do you listen to asmr videos my values weren t exactly lining up with the traditions i hold dear to my heart my fi isn t agreeing with my si today while i m in love with you might sound more appropriate in the early stages i feel like i love you sounds more committed something that might be said later in a relationship it amazing the things that can trigger a person fi my other fi friends get heated about the most random things that wouldn t bother me something to consider before voting which sounds more harmless for the first time to a romantic partner trying to keep my cool is a hard thing for me but same tho istjs at work school etc that against the rules in leisure time me that against the rules istj i d o nt car e lets do i t emotions are coming back i just recently became friends with another infp and i m just wondering where he been all my life i have a much harder time telling little white lies than big huge lies my best friend is an enfp lol i ve been a much happier person since i decided to be a more rational person i haven t been very emotional at all lately is there something wrong with me in an interesting turn of events one of my new isfj friends actually tried to get to know me instead of the other way around this is a tough job for nfs especially but trust me it will save you so much trouble in the real world learn how to not be offended sit back analyze why you re feeling offended rationalize is it worth being offended over i ve finally found my long awaited istj friend if you re an infp don t listen to your type by carly rae jepsen unless you wanna get into your feels

infp,me af ok class pick a partner when someone tells me that i should be more talkative and outgoing even if someone means well by giving me criticism i will still probably take it to heart and think about it for three days straight it will affect your grade if you do not participate in class discussions when i finally get alone time after dealing with other people for far too long live shot of me deciding on whether or not to leave my house and go socialize for once when i get empathy overload and i just gotta check out for a bit my romanticize everything game is strong af i have to fake extroversion in some social situations and it makes me feel so inauthentic when all the self checkout lanes are closed and you gotta make small talk with the cashiers no one understands me like you do myers briggs when someone cancels plans for something you didn t want to go to in the first place when someone about to compliment me in front of a large group of people don t underestimate my ability to avoid confrontation like it the plague i d much rather listen to a conversation than be the center of one when i finally speak up and contribute to the conversation and no one acknowledges it how is it possible that i am so ambitious and yet so lazy at the same time me as i make up situations in my head that will never happen update despite unfavorable results in the past my go to social strategy will remain won t speak until spoken to just stop overthinking things i find it strange that i somehow have real emotional reactions to hypothetical conversations in my head oh the accuracy when i m suddenly the center of attention me of the time when i m forced to make small talk with a stranger i like to think he an infp too but i believe most people type him as an infj i d say a case can be made for each one what are you doing with your life life of an infp i can t stop myself from analyzing every social interaction i have immediately after it happens you see things you keep quiet about them and you understand you re a wallflower i get excited about the stories i m going to act out in my head before i go to sleep all my feelings about public speaking in one simple gif when i get an unexpected phone call this is how i d love to respond to many social invitations how about we go around the room and introduce ourselves i go back and forth between wanting someone out there to truly understand me and accepting that no one ever really will omg you re so quiet two infps deciding where they want to go eat will eventually starve from indecision small talk was created by satan himself soooo accurate ah the ever continuing struggle of being a perfectionist and a procrastinator when someone suggests we do something i am extremely productive at doing rather unimportant things this speaks to my soul i m so glad i have daydreaming to turn to when i m in situations or places i don t want to be james vincent mcmorrow music feels like it made specifically for infps it crazy how one minute i love everyone and everything about the human race and the next i want a plague to wipe everyone out these are the days where i hate everything and everybody my thoughts are with those involved in senseless act there an actual word for it love me some rainy days the awkward moment when you re the only liberal person in your family and the discussion of gay marriage comes up man i m gonna miss jon stewart i feel like it pointless trying to explain myself because i know no one will truly understand me hell at times i don t understand me i hate when people infer that shyness is something that i must overcome this is definitely me when my friends invite me to go out this is how i feel about most situations i really just want to watch pride and prejudice and pretend like i don t have a ton of school work to do haha thanks for the offer but i m way too much a perfectionist to let someone else write my paper it tempting though guess who has a research paper due on friday but hasn t started it yet i love when people talk about me like i m not in the room maybe maybe not maybe go f yourself we re only here briefly and while i m here i want to allow myself joy because the point never was achieving the dream it was having one and pouring everything into it my plans for tonight are to watch dead poets society and cry i m always writing a story in my mind i ve actually dropped a class because oral presentations were required i hate being told i m too shy i m well aware it not like i m choosing to be shy and telling me to be talkative does not help anything it so weird how well i can gauge how someone else is feeling i love rainy days

infp,should i try to save the world by doing x y and z or do i relax my whole life and let an extrovert handle it poll what kind of music do you listen to when you need to get your mind off things i m forever falling victim to emotional vampires u would think i would ve learned by now but my empathy gets in the way of logic many thanks for the bday wishes today is my birthday and winter solstice we re very vulnerable when driving i think we re most human in moments like that so it hard not to recognize others existences i m really feeling the human connection recently i was brought to tears today as i was driving home seeing everyone in their cars slightly convinced that introverts are telepathic and that why we don t involve ourselves with of the people we meet me wanting to be alone is not synonymous with wanting to be away from you so many friendships shattered over this misunderstanding i m haunted by daydreams of what my fullest potential could be had i been born in a world free of money and agendas i was not born to be a slave in corporate society and that why i often struggle with happiness thx for your love keep spreading it ppl like u are the reason the world hasn t gone up in flames forever in love w my infp poll what do you need to work on when it comes to romantic relationships i am the sun and i am the moon i trust myself but i think i m crazy i know nothing but i also know everything me as well suppression of affection has always been one of my struggles i m such a loving person but not many would ever know why cant i small talk why do i only breed words on obscure topics why cant i talk abt the weather w out bringing up global warming i m really bad at being affectionate which makes no sense considering the swarm of butterflies in my stomach at all times hi lovely lady thank u so much i often go thru periods of time where i m at a loss for words amp don t feel confident in my wit i don t care how beautiful or intelligent or sweet you are if my initial instincts say no then you ve got to go poll what would your perfect autumn day consist of once i m in a routine everything is easy but if one thing throws me off schedule then i spend the next month trying to catch up you are a breath of fresh air within humanity pollution even the butterflies know it i m the most optimistic pessimist i know poll how would you best identify yourself when it comes to the idea of a god source supreme being it really frustrating how my personality is dependent on how comfortable i am my greatest talent making up excuses those am i actually anor just bipolar moments i swear i m a cool outgoing person just give me like more hangout sessions to prove it summer is the time when introverts are forced into uncomfortable situations just because it in season halfway done w and it been nothing but a challenge i suggest meditation and less social media for those who are empathic like me so handsome p dark circles are a sign of a hardworking or deep thinking individual i talk highly of the moon and poorly of society priorities i m a computer that goes into sleep mode when i m forced to be around people i don t vibe with note to self if i don t dislike you then i probably love you and vice versa because there no gray area when it comes to who i spend my time on why are u crying ur thinking way too much into things have u figured out your life plan yet aw u should smile more i made a blog about humanity and i hope it goes nowhere so i ll keep being honest when i grow tired of fantasizing about my future i switch gears and fantasize about my next existence i m a type which basically means i m the personification of an everlasting sigh if there a way to have extremely low self esteem but somehow manage to be self absorbed i ve figured it out i m good at pretending to be a socialite when i have to be but that doesn t mean my insides aren t screaming runnnnnnn how did i end up with one of the most socially up in your face jobs on the planet how have i survived am i even alive when you re hanging out with someone and they go i invited a couple friends to come too if that cool i wish and wish and wish for something but when the opportunity is finally handed to me i feel like i m being suffocated telling me to stop overanalyzing will actually have the opposite effect because you re basically announcing one of my insecurities i love you so because you balance me out in the most natural of ways caution strangers i will read you and determine my feelings for you and predict your future all within our second encounter i fell in love and it tops my list of the most melodramatic things i ve done thus far a majority of my friendships relationships are long distance and i wonder if i meant for it to be this way from the beginning i enjoy the simple things in life but i ll never live a simple life masochism avoid tomorrow by staying up as late as possible resulting in less sleep amp making the day more unbearable than originally some days it near impossible for me to get words out no matter how active my brain is and let me tell you it one of those days doesn t communicate doesn t get what i want it not my fault you didn t pick up on my signals i made them very clear this time my tweets will eventually contradict each other as a reflection of my actual mind forever in a state of guilt for things happening on other continents to people i don t know waits so many days to return someone call that i have to fake a story about how i left my phone on the moon and just got it back oh please excuse the crystal ball in my brain idk how i ve survived this complex of being if i don t feel a magnetic pull towards you from the beginning don t get excited about the fate of our acquaintance the i actually stands for indecisive when someone mentions myers briggs at a social gathering learning to shed the outer layers that aren t needed and go back to the purest form of me my love for people cannot be contained in the realms of technology in other words sorry i didn t text back again if not careful falling in love means fading away i am erratic in the calmest way possible and the paradoxes don t stop there extroversion is the key to success but introversion is the key to my house which is way more comfortable how do i balance my love for humans and my hatred for society new years resolution find a diet to lose the weight of the world

infp,i need to psychoanalyze myself right now to know what i m feeling misty emotions i m not feeling good it been awhile since i came here for the last time my life turns out to be pretty stable and good it only shows how crazy and obsessed she really was is it been a long time and their story is pretty much bad so that she can keep pictures and moments of themselves i d really appreciate if my boyfriend ex deleted the pictures she has with him of her instagram account that need you have of going home because there is your shelter god help me trying to make her see one day she screams and uses acid words and won t it ever change because she thinks it ok to be like this and she ll never get how to treat people that what hurting me right now its my sister and it doesn t matter how hard i try she ll never get it it hurts knowing that i can t put it into words too the way she uses words that cut like knives it hurts they never keep it inside as i do they just let go but god it still here surrounding my thoughts they never feel guilty they never feel it hitting our soul they never apologize they never feel like they re wrong i feel impotence because they can t feel what i feel they will never do it so frustrating when people don t see our point of view and turn it around to make it look bad i feel like i wanna cry and it has a long time i don t feel like this and push down the ones we care about in order to make us feel something and i feel i feel so bad try to make me look like a loser and to make them feel better they push us down i feel so overwhelmed it so stressing when people don t comprehend me and worse and write i should write to get this out of my chest it poisoning it self destructing what im feeling now is one of those moments where you have to stop and take a deep breath whatever i can t put it into words and ended in the most cliche way just because again they couldn t show the emotion the moment brought instead they threw us a sequence of individual scenes that weren t connecting well because the best bond would be the emotion at least or like that how much trauma they all had acquired people just watching the movie should see this too and feel it how i felt reading the book they lost pretty important people and killed others as well they couldn t show how in panic she was her head got severely damaged after the war as it is common as a side effect of a war but they really missed the psychological atmosphere the story involves which is what got me i guess they reproduced the actions scenes pretty well better than what i thought and imagined i ve just watched mockingjay part ii and well i ve read the book so of course i have some objections about it thanks for all the gifts you ve been giving me what an amazing day thanks god thanks thanks thanks nocaute well i love the love of my life i never imagined i could be this happy with someone aaaaaaaaaaaah it hurts it frightens me i fell in love fuck now true he got minutes to see me so i can leave it doesn t mean im not shaking i got closer cuz the more i look ridiculous better that why i don t care i ll never have contact with any of these people again it doesn t matter how ridiculous i look i ll never be as ridiculous as he is standing in front of the person that destroyed my world thinking the best thing to do i m the kind of person that gets home and stays a long time inside the car just to be alone for some minutes with no one bothering me can t let go pain splattered teardrops on my shirt god please make it stop i m screaming internally why do i do this to me psychopath he insists on coming and going and disappearing then coming back everything all over again it destroys me if you re gone just don t come back you piece of shit guess god protecting me from doing shit to my life i d rather think this is god speaking and putting things in order hope so cuz i m done with this history everything so fucking confusing specially bc he practically said that all he wanted was to fool me again i mean it what he meant so i get melancholic thinking about all of this because they keep you wondering how things would be if it wasn t for this and for that things like that and i know he maybe a psychopath or a pathological liar but the doubt the maybe kills me and then it came back like a wave bc he came back and turned my world around all over again you know the worst of it all is that i d already forgotten i was over it he not a normal person hasn t stopped lying or anything like that today all i want to do is stay in this melancholic state until sadness goes away they re not half crazy as i am to understand my behavior and all they know doing is judging i m not feeling ok and i can t tell anyone about it cuz it about dealing with someone nobody want to know about how i wish i could go to a solitary beach to reload my energies and think it hurting again i cannot believe you wanted to fool me again the thing is that u re not that person i thought i knew and nothing gonna change that nothing gonna change you bebe tu mesmo do teu veneno a cruz sagrada seja minha luz não seja o dragão meu guia retira te satanás não me aconselhes coisas vãs é mal que tu me oferece eu tava tão bem pq deus pq por que mais mentiras gotta get out of this laziness biggest comfort zone i ve ever been stuck in how can i make plans and accomplish them tell me need to recharge myself maybe i m feeling impotent helpless hopeless

infp,i so desperately wish i was riding with you miss you all also want to hear about the con call moro nite awoman messaged me today saying that she thinks amp hopesis the future of ourmeetup had around attendees it was lit meetup update check this map our meetup location will be on the north side of constitution between th amp th slayyyyy nonviolently cant wait to see you how far along are you banner crew what your eta best friends of today y all it son the radio it lit i heard on i d like to talk to these women as ai d love to talk w you on what other violent act would u say u have give of your personal resources have a valid opinion on it whether i am able house homeless my home would have absolutely bearing on my desire end homelessness i plan to foster adopt soon but would a different answer make my desire to end violence null amp void no i will be on msnbc during their am news hour tomorrow talking the women march we also support privacy and the right to make choices with one body but the preborn child has those inherent rights too see the th amendment doesn t trump the rights of other humans to live lethal violence is contrary to all rights bodily autonomy is limited we do not have the right to do violence to other human beings imagine if advocates against human trafficking rape culture war were told mind their own business every time they spoke against violence also i think it contrary to human constitutional rights to harm or hurt them why is this controversial it not from a prolife website i have a friend in medical school and i ve seen the embryology texts lol got it i will try to find it i encourage u to read textbook like the developing human clinically oriented embryology human life starts fertilization original not welcome if unwanted pro life feminists fight discrimination at women march not seeing that a human being is a human being doesn t make violence against that human acceptable lol yeah it was not my original title they didn t even run it by me obviously clickbait thanks for editing it was my pleasure rude boi honestly i might be most honored byandcalling me their friends than anything else i eileen i d ask you to consider no human being should be excluded from human rights abortion deprives preborn hum thank you our voices against misogyny xenophobia hate and violence need to be amplified now more than ever thank you for your kind words and well wishes hoping everyone stays safe and that our voices against misogyny amp ha original title not welcome if unwanted fight discrimination at women march title change thank you patty i believe the future ofisand the future of feminist is prolife ew not my goal my goal is to end violence against humans trump does not represent me and my consistently pro life views i support common sense gun regulations yes may i inquire what species you believe the fetus is in a woman pregnancy human fetus human offspring child i support the right tochoices incl healthcare choices abortion kills a human so it categorically out your condescension indicates an unwillingness to engage my arguments amp is rather paternalistic good day sir also i must remark on how incredibly ableist amp ageist it is to declare preborn human beings unworthy of rights swhen science improves amp viability moves to days after conception what will your position be just curious so what stage in development are you talking at least from prior polling more women are prolife than men i would love to see the most recent data too viability changes based on location in time amp space are we going to base human rights on where when you live we humans are all clumps of tissue at different stages of development your language is meant to dehumanize the human being goes through stages of development ages embryo fetus neonate infant toddler etc etc believe it or not it on my list of things i oppose along withand idk what kind of textbook you had in th grade bio but mine said that human parents create human offspring it not a belief it facts saying a human fetus isn t a human being is like saying the earth is flat definition from multiple dictionaries a member of the species homo sapiens the pre born obviously fit interesting successful abortion always kills a defenseless child literally of the time we are still going andare still going to representand the we should not keep a form of violence legal just because people might do it anyway we should protect all humans please read a biology textbook like the developing human clinically oriented embryology thx absolutely me right now i direct you to the developing human clinically oriented embryology to learn about human development i would like you to tell me why you think it an opinion a product of a same species fertilization is a member of same species that i e human beings make human beings hey there any word on the oped especially pertinent due to the way this is all blowing up either all humans deserve to live w o violence or none of us do injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere mlkjr absolutely not the death penalty is contrary to inherent human dignity what sorry i didn t comprehend your tweet clarify please i support and advocate for restorative models of justice plz look it up thx

infp,lol never this is how you eat a chocolate chip cookie you eat around the chocolate chips cuz they re gross but the cookie p whatever you have you re expected to make more of it and what you lack is no excuse for not doing so preach blake sometimes a person behavior apologizes before their mouth does that means everything when a person has learned their lesson be quiet don t continue to drive the conviction in say no more about it ppl resent the lord mercy to u bcz they want u to pay for what uv done but i thank god that he is not like men and i thank him for jesus the more you understand god ways the less you resent the disadvantages in your life they are all part of the plan some people know the word of god so well that they can speak it in any language why are you looking among the dead for someone who is alive the lord does not judge us as men do he sees the things we don t everybody not meant to see you if some people weren t blind you wouldn t be able to handle the attention you d get its people out there eyes wide open looking for what you got and you re wasting your time doing sign language to a blind person and if you really are great and someone can t see it move along even if you manage to pry open blind eyes you still can t make them see greatness need not announce itself i m turned off by people who try to sell me on how great they are if it is true i will see it whether they tell me or not there is a certain type of person that i complement very well and i find myself most attracted to that type but t every word you say to someone makes a difference every idle word and for all of them we each will give an account the lies you believe about yourself will send you down the wrong path if you don t constantly replace the lies with truth family i don t know how jesus did it i m tired you begin to think differently approve of good things and reject evil and your behavior changes after the pattern of your new thoughts you feed the maturation of the new nature by reading the word of god until your mind and thought patterns begin to change to reflect his salvation is not behavior modification or an act you put on to know how to mingle with christians it a new nature altogether there no way you can be prepared for everything you have to condition ur character to be able to respond well to things you don t expect jesus christ came to save sinners you can have perfect theology but if you have no love your theology is imperfect no matter how hard they try a person cannot be someone that it is not in them to be if you don t let people grow and change you ll lose them if you walk with christ and the people closest to you aren t committed to daily walking in the spirit you will catch it when it comes to spiritual warfare satan loves to empower the people who can shoot at you from close range spiritual warfare is a real and expected part of ministry but the most unexpected part for me is always who the darts come from corinthians says that love keeps no record of wrongs but there no prohibition against remembering the good if the answers to certain questions are irrelevant i try not to ask those questions when i have a strange dream it so hard for me to go back to sleep the lord leading in your life will likely have absolutely nothing to do with what practical the just shall live by faith i have a tv and for the life of me i can t figure out how to work it for anything other than youtube sermons even my tv is saved nobody goes out and looks for what they already have when u only appreciate something when u fear losing it what u really appreciate is ur own comfort not the person or thing you may lose when you re willing to bless people without regard for what you ll get out of it yourself their blessings tend to spill over onto you a good man steps are ordered nothing just happens those first invited to the wedding banquet were too busy and weren t interested the king filled the wedding hall anyways the lord offers you many blessings but he won t force you to accept them the lord often hides his greatest gifts inside what seems undesirable to repel superficial people who won t appreciate the blessing anyway true you just diagnosed my whole life you know the deal being talked to death as usual lol the real question is what is being done to this truth right here lol praaaaaay for me if agreement from others is what you need before you can follow the lord leading you might as well stay right where you are ppl won t understand why u do what u do because they don t understand that you know things they don t you follow the lord they ll learn people want you to move and act according to what they know but if the lord has caused you to know better he expects you to do better people always come back months and years later to say that they now see how right you were but you will have missed your opportunity if the lord has made a thing known to you act according and don t postpone your obedience to wait for other people agreement jesus mt you testify against urselves that ur the descendants of those who murdered the prophets go ahead then amp complete what ur ancestors started peut être i really can t function after pm anymore i plan my whole day just so i can get in bed as early as possible love you sis even if a person is an atheist or whether it the idol of power money knowledge or some other ideal still satan is being worshiped i don t think i have an actual account but maybe i do lol idk it tough being a soft person in a hard place if you make your appeal to righteousness based on how you keep the law you must be perfect we endure anything rather than put an obstacle in the way of the gospel of christ paul if your spending increases every time your money increases what have you gained there abundance in living a modest life you will have so much more when you don t chase things you don t need you are in error because you neither know the scriptures nor the power of god happy birthday what goes into someone mouth does not defile them but what comes out of their mouth that is what defiles them jesus matthew
